<h1>No more rigged and stolen elections in Minnesota</h1>
<small>Let's start by fixing 2020</small>
</header>

<p>
	We the People have lost confidence in our elections process. We understand that election machines (s)elect the leader of the free world and those who runs our children's schools.
</p><p>
	The 2020 election was rigged and stolen in Minnesota. This should never be allowed to happen again. 
</p><p>
	As Minnesota's next Secretary of State, I will make sure of that.
<strong>
	Join me in reclaiming the government for the people.
</strong>
	They are the most reliable, flexible, and long-lasting option.
	Here’s why.
</p><h2>
	PORTABLE
</h2><p>
	I’ve brought my text files with me since 1990, from Mac to Windows to Linux to BSD, from PCs to laptops to tablets to Android to iOS to a tiny device the size of my thumb, and back again.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Every device, including ones long gone, and ones not invented yet, can read and edit plain text.
</strong>
	Whether future virtual reality, or a chip you can implant in your earlobe, plain text will be there.
	Will Microsoft Word?
	Evernote?
	Notion?
	Maybe.
	Maybe not.
</p><p>
	But plain text?
	Always.
	Everywhere.
</p><h2>
	UN-COMMERCIAL
</h2><p>
	Every few years a new company says you should use their special format.
	You have to pay them a monthly fee to use it — or keep all of your documents in their care.
	They offer some convenience or features, but at the cost of flexibility, portability, and independence.
</p><p>
	When you store your writing in one company’s unique format, then you need that program to access it.
	Then the economy takes a turn, they go out of business, and your work is trapped in an unusable format.
</p><p>
<strong>
	You will outlive these companies.
</strong>
	Your writing should outlive you.
	Depending on companies is not an option.
</p><p>
	Plain text is un-commercial.
	It removes you from the world of subscriptions and hype.
	There will always be plenty of free, non-commercial software in the public domain for reading and editing text files.
</p><h2>
	OFFLINE
</h2><p>
	There are places and times when you can’t get online.
	Don’t depend on any tool that needs an internet connection.
</p><p>
<strong>
	There are great benefits to being intentionally offline and unreachable, to focus.
</strong>
	It’s a super productivity boost.
	You need to be able to write, and have access to all your writing, during these times.
