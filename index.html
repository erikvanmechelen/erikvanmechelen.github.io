<h1>No more rigged elections in Minnesota</h1>
<small>Toward Free, Fair, and 100% Auditable Elections</small>
</header>

<p>
	We the People have lost confidence in our elections process. We don't trust the machines which slice and dice our votes; we don't like insecure mass mail-in absentee ballots; we have lost faith in internet-connected poll books linked to the statewide voter registration system in the cloud which knows when you check in to vote on election day (and who doesn't).

</p><p>
	Is it not the case that this broken process not only (s)elects the leader of the free world but also those who run our children's schools? The software underpinning Dominion, ES&S, and Hart is Smartmatic (Sequoia), which has not only determined election in the United States but very likely abroad.
</p><p>
	Yes, the 2020 election was also rigged in Minnesota. But (s)elections have been taking place for quite some time. Sadly we may never know what happened in 2018 because under USC 52 Chapter 207 §20701 physical and digital election records need only be maintained for 22 months. However, despite a massive coverup attempt and aggressive censorship, we are learning what happened in 2020. For example, an analysis of the Mesa County, Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS) server from the 2020 and 2021 elections <a href="<a href=https://mega.nz/file/OxFSjKTR#BysgZkjnmXQwFl2bqo2_0ufAvQOQ7IwOzFxiItavfzg target=_new>" target=_new>proved database manipulation</a> that initially went undetected by the office of the county clerk and recorder, Tina Peters. Only her courageous decision to save images of the server before and after the Dominion "Trusted Build" in Spring 2021 preserved the opportunity for data analysts to investigate. This work made it possible for the rest of us to learn information I imagine Dominion never wanted you to know. Is Minnesota also paying this vendor for its services?

</p<p>
	And yet, with all this EVIDENCE??? where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? Or we can put the truth on the table, brick by brick. In other states like Nevada, county commissioners are already making decisions to remove electronic voting equipment from upcoming elections. Minnesotans have attended their county commissioner meetings speaking toward those same ends—that trend is likely to continue. Our legislators could draw up legislation like Arizona (COMPLETE THIS), or LINK TO THIS (version of MagaRaccoon's legislation which I sent to Bret Bussman).
</p><p>
	What happened in 2020 (and in the preceding decades) should never be allowed to happen again. As Minnesota's next Secretary of State, I will make sure of that.
</p><p>
	Going forward, your voice and vote will count, perhaps for the first time in your life.
</p><p>
	This past year, I've worked with and learned from local and national grassroots leaders including some of the very best in the fields of cyber security, networks, law, and information warfare, to be well equipped for the road ahead. This <a href="https://leanpub.com/mn2020/" target=_new>book</a> details that ongoing journey.
	</p><p>
	This all being said, the failed and corrupt political establishment's time is up. It would be an honor to serve you in public office.
</p><p>
	What's perhaps more important is that you stay as informed as you can while continuing to ask questions. The powers that be don't like when we ask questions, but if we don't hold those in public office accountable, who will? We are the people we've been waiting for.
<strong>
	Please join me in reclaiming the government for We the People.
