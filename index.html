<h1>Accountability, Transparency, and Integrity in Local Government</h1>
<br>
<p>
	Erik van Mechelen's work toward ending election corruption and re-establishing accountability started in 2021. Joining grassroots county commissioner meetings, he learned more about election laws, process, and electronic systems—he published a brief book on his initial findings called <a href="https://leanpub.com/sim2020" target=_new>[S]elections in Minnesota.</a> He ran for MN Secretary of State as a republican in the August 9, 2022 primary election, accuring nearly 111,000 votes (36.9%).
	<br><br>
	Erik also helps people discover and share their stories in written form.
