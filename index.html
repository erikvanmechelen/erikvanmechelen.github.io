<h1>Choose Candidates on Aug 9 that have SHOWN You They Have the Capability to Achieve TRUE Election Integrity</h1>
<p>
	For too long, we've worshiped self-described experts with elegant talking points.
</p><p>
	For too long, we've trusted the Party process to choose republican candidates.
</p><p>
	For too long, we haven't truly THOUGHT about who should represent us and be a public servant in office, whether in the school board, legislature, or the Office of the Secretary of State.
</p><p>
	Now, we must vote for candidates that have PROVEN to you that they have been successful in making changes they say they seek. Even then, with the election cartel's ability to rig elections through mass mail in ballots (as seen in <a href="https://rumble.com/v1br9k9-the-real-deal.html" target=_new>2000 Mules</a>) and electronic manipulation (as seen in <a href="https://selectioncode.com" target=_new>Selection Code</a>), our showing up in huge numbers in person to vote for America First candidates may not be enough to win every race—but we have to try.
</p><p>
	As seen in Colorado, Georgia, and elsewhere, primary elections are already being visibly rigged, republican vs. republican.
</p><p>
	On primary election night, August 9, 2022, I will be watching several pivotal county commissioner, senate, and house races in addition the secretary of state race for which I am a republican candidate.
</p><p>
	Get up to the minute election night reporting for Minnesota starting on August 9, 2022 <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/primaryresults.asp" target=_new>HERE</a> and commentary through my <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com" target=_new>substack newsletter, Midwest Seeds</a>.
</p>
<h2>Take Action</h2>
<p>
	While voting is important, we must also <a href="https://erikformn.us/action.html" target=_new> endeavor mightily</a> to fix our broken election process and system.
</p>
<p>
	Don't wait for someone else to clean up your local elections. It's time to <a href="https://erikformn.us/action.html" target=_new>dig in</a> to understanding the laws, process, and systems of elections in our cities, counties, and states. If not you, who?

<h2>Take Action—The Machines Must Go</h2>
<p>
	We've gone from "prove it" to "what can we do about it?" Here's what you can do...
</p><p>
	If you do not accept the machines counting votes, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKZjZMFlj8w" target=_new>make your voice heard</a> at county commissioners meetings (every other Tuesday).
</p><p>
	If no one is yet doing this in your county, be a leader. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsvzcZIrRk8" target=_new>Speak from what you know</a> and emphasize:
</p><p>
	    - Paper pollbooks to reduce registration inflation<br>
		- No electronic voting machines or tabulation systems<br>
	    - Hand tally (hand count) the paper ballots <br>
		- The MN legislature should ban drop boxes and absentee / mail-in ballots (except for long-distance military, disabled, or sick) <br>
	    - County Commissioners have the power to remove epollbooks, electronic voting equipment, and return to hand tallying paper <br>
		- County Commissioners are responsible for certifying their county's election results
		- Same goes for Cities and Townships
