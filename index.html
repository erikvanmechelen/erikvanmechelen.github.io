	<em>"Not since the Manhattan Project, which developed the Atom Bomb, have so many smart people worked together to solve such a critical problem."</em> – Jeffrey O'Donnell, one of the authors of the <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf" target=_new>Mesa County Colorado Voting Systems Report #3</a> on Election Database and Process Analysis of Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS)
</p><p>
	In the early 1900s it took Bertrand Russell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica" target=_new>over 300 pages</a> to prove that 1 + 1 = 2. Thankfully with the work being done around the country since before November 3rd, 2020, it will not take nearly as long to unpack the state of our rigged election system and how to fix it.
</p><p>
	We the People have lost confidence in our elections process. Already in 2016 and earlier many were questioning election results, a sentiment which has intensified. We don't trust the machines which slice and dice our votes nor the backdoors into election management systems; we don't like insecure mass mail-in absentee ballots and drop boxes exploited by vote trafficking organizations; we have lost faith in internet-connected poll books and inflated voter rolls obscured from public view. When Minnesotans wanted proper audits of the ballots and the machines or simply cast vote record (CVR) reports, roadblocks were put in their path.
</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
	The combination of:
	<ol>
		<li>election machines
		<li>mass mail-in ballots, and
		<li>inflated voter rolls
	</ol>
		leads to (s)elections.
</p><p>
	Let's take these one at a time.
</p>
<h3>1. The Machines</h3>
<p>
	The software underpinning Dominion, ES&S, and Hart is Smartmatic (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Voting_Systems" target=_new>Sequoia</a>), which has not only determined elections in the United States, but also as far afield as Venezuala already in 2004. Digital ballot trafficking is a critical issue: after your ballot is scanned in to Dominion, ES&S, or Hart tabulators your voice through your vote can be changed in the backend of the servers storing those data points. Yes, ballot harvesting and ballot stuffing can cancel a real person's vote, but the machines can do so at scale in the 'black box' not even accessible to most election officials in charge of running elections in their counties. The following chart from Expert Witness <a href="https://livestream.com/accounts/25225474/events/9117221/videos/214677184" target=_new>Russ Ramsland's Presentation</a> at Georgia State House Elections Hearing on December 10th, 2020 provides an overview of vulnerabilities.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>2. Mass Mail-in Ballots</h3>
<p>
	The documentary <a href="https://2000mules.com/" target=_new>2000 Mules</a> is alarming in part because it demonstrates the coordinated operation that is physical ballot trafficking, but also because additional questions arise: Who printed these ballots? With which templates? How were they provided to the mules? How did they cover their digital tracks? On the last question, is it possible that tabulators have internal code to hide ballot dumps and removes excess votes for the popular candidate?
</p><p>
	True the Vote's <a href="https://www.truethevote.org/election-integrity-testimony-in-wisconsin-on-thursday-march-24-2022/" target=_new>election integrity testimony</a> in Wisconsin on March 24, 2022 and the <a href="https://www.truethevote.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FILE_5193_no-meta.pdf" target=_new>election integrity report</a> is a great introduction to what some have called the election cartel.
</p><p>
	In Minnesota, <a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/47803963-5178-4387-9865-0ea08f5332bd/downloads/22%2003%2017%20grewing%20complaint%20with%20exhibits.pdf?ver=1648648812808" target=_new>consent decrees</a> removed witness and signature requirements on absentee ballots opening the floodgates to now legal but ethically questionable ballots.
</p>
<h3>3. Inflated Voter Rolls</h3>
<p>
	How do we know that voter rolls are inflated, providing an ample supply of ready-to-launch voters?
	</p><p>
	First of all, remember that these voter rolls and histories are public information that you can request from the <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/election-administration-campaigns/data-maps/registered-voter-list-requests/" target=_new>Minnesota Secretary of State's website</a> for $46. Note that your request is made at a particular moment in time. However, if you request a list before and after an election, as people like <a href="https://midwestswampwatch.com" target=_new>Rick Weible</a> did for the November 3rd, 2020 General Election, and you are handy with database management (these are big files) then you can see how the lists changed. If you were to continue to request lists every few weeks, then you could see how the lists change over time, sometimes dramatically. (Going forward, it should not require experts in database management to hold our government accountable.)
</p><p>
	On election day, electronic pollbooks connected to the internet provide access to the statewide voter registration system (SVRS) in the cloud. It should be noted that in Minnesota voters can be toggled between active and inactive status. Ask yourself, what benefit might there be to the e-pollbooks being connected to the SVRS in the cloud from the perspective of monitoring or even controlling an election outcome? The current Minnesota Attorney General's <a href="https://twitter.com/keithellison/status/1323746158557253632" target=_new>tweet</a> at 3:57pm on election day suggests he had some knowledge of votes being cast in real time. Could it be that the system notes which voters do not vote (neither submitting an absentee/mail-in vote nor voting in person in the precinct) and adds those voters to the phantom voter pile?
</p><p>
	What is the result of election machines, mass mail-in ballots, and inflated voter rolls? The result is that this broken process not only (s)elects the leader of the free world, but also those who run our children's schools. How many times will a school board candidate who is well respected, competent, and very popular, somehow <italic>lose</italic> her race by a slim margin? Think back to elections you've voted in. Has nothing ever felt off to you?
</p>
<h2>What Happened in Minnesota?</h2>
<p>
	With more than 85% voter turnout combined with absentee or mail-in ballots representing 58% of votes (1,906,383 votes), Minnesota immediately put up red flags before any details were examined. Also at a high level, the following graphic shows how the votes were sent through to the media. Notice the <strong>negative 194,846 votes</strong> near interval 50. What may have caused that?
</p>
<br>
<img src=Minnesota_Percentage_Control.JPG style="height:250px">
<br>
<p>
	Already based on this information there is much to investigate. After extensive review it appears the November 3rd, 2020 election was also rigged in Minnesota affecting multiple races. But the problem is bigger than that: (s)elections have been taking place for quite some time, probably since electronic equipment was introduced at scale in the early 2000s (prior to that, <a href="https://projectapario.com/timeline/RR111FF911F18III444F/page/BSJPPLS4T/notes" target=_new>old school methods</a> were used).
</p><p>
	It is likely that Democrats and Republicans have been (s)elected through this method, keeping the establishment in control while appeasing you and me with the illusion that our side occasionally one. They want us to think that if we didn't win a particular election, that's okay because 'we'll get them next time.' They want us to be divided against our neighbor so we miss the bigger game. We cannot continue being lured into thinking like this and must admit to ourselves where we allowed ourselves to be led astray.
</p><p>
	Sadly we may never know the details of what happened in 2018 (and before) because under <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&num=0&edition=prelim" target=_new>USC 52 Chapter 207 §20701</a> physical and digital election records need only be maintained for 22 months.
</p><p>
	But thankfully they <em>do</em> have to be maintained for 22 months. While we may learn the truth about 2018, by contrast in 2020, despite a massive coverup attempt and aggressive censorship, the details of the coup are coming into the light for all to see. For example, an analysis of the Mesa County, Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS) server from the 2020 and 2021 elections <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf" target=_new> proved database manipulation</a> that initially went undetected by the office of the county clerk and recorder, Tina Peters. Only her courageous decision to save images of the server before and after the Dominion "Trusted Build" in Spring 2021 preserved the opportunity for data analysts to investigate. That work made it possible for the rest of us to learn information I imagine Dominion never wanted us to know. J. Alex Halderman's <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/sos/30lawens/Antrim.pdf" target=_new> report from Antrim</a>, County Michigan is also instructive on Dominion. More recently, the United States Election Assistance Commission Report of Investigation into Dominion Voting Systems D-Suite 5.5-B in Williamson, County, Tennessee found a <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/voting_system/files/EAC_Report_of_Investigation_Dominion_DSuite_5.5_B.pdf" target=_new>serious anomaly</a> causing 7 of 18 ICP tabulators used during the election to not match the number of ballots scanned.
</p><p>
	In conversations I've observed or had with election officials in Minnesota, so far none have said they've lost faith in the electronic voting equipment. Again, what was shown in the Mesa County Report #3, where database manipulation happened in October, was that the election officials could not have been responsible for the changes. From this perspective, it's very possible that many election officials are hostages in a bad system.
</p><p>
	But supposing you wanted to verify the output of the machine process with the results reported by precints, counties, or the secretary of state's website—how could you do that? One way would be to examine the cast vote record (CVR) reports, which are automatically generated by the tabulators as ballots are scanned in. However, to date, despite the clarity of <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/13" target=_new>CHAPTER 13, GOVERMENT DATA PRACTICES</a>, no CVRs have been shared with any Minnesotan requesting them, although one county attorney has said in writing that they do not have them, which either shows 1) a lack of understanding of how the machines work, 2) a lack of understanding of election record retention laws, or 3) potentially an understanding that if shared the CVR provides the public a way to check the accuracy of reported election results.
</p><p>
	You could also do a full and complete audit of ballots, tabulators, and election management systems. A partial audit was done in Maricopa County and men and women in Otero County, New Mexico are currently conducting an audit of their county's 2020 General Election. <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.89" target=_new>Minnesota Statute 206.89 POSTELECTION REVIEW OF VOTING SYSTEMS</a> hand counts ballots returned by the optical scan ballot counters in select precincts, known as a <a href="https://www.sos.state.mn.us/elections-voting/how-elections-work/post-election-reviews/" target=_new>postelection review</a>. (These are sometimes referred to as risk-limiting audits.) In a postelection review in Dakota County's Precinct 4950, WEST ST PAUL W-2 P-2, the total unadjusted difference was 870 votes. 7 of those 870 votes were explained, but 863 were not explained. Why then does the total adjusted difference (the last column) show all zeros? The total adjusted difference should read 863. Even with 65% (863 out of 1327) of the total votes in this postelection review left unexplained, the Final Results row says this is a "Difference of not more than 0.5%" and the Total Adjusted Difference is "0%", deemed "ACCEPTABLE".
</p>
<br>
<img src="/precinct4950.png" alt="Precinct 4950: Total Unadjusted Difference = 870">
<br>
<p>
	Of course, this is clearly <strong>not</strong> acceptable and it begs the question: How many more precincts would turn up red flags like this if more postelection reviews had been done? And how many more red flags might be raised if proper audits were done? With this work being shown to Minnesotans, it would be strange if they were not asking for audits and accountability.
</p><p>
	With a lack of transparency and demonstrated gaps in the election process across the country and in Minnesota, many have asked, Where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could even give up.
</p><p>
	Or we can decide to put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of willful ignorance. Once enough people see what's wrong, available remedies will be welcomed.
</p>
<h2>Available Remedies</h2>
<p>
	Speaking of remedies... In other states like Nevada, county commissioners are already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE" target=_new> making decisions</a> to remove electronic voting equipment from upcoming elections and making plans to return to counterfeit-proof paper ballots hand-counted in precinct on a single election day, greatly simplifying the process. Minnesotans have attended their county commissioner meetings and <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing" target=_new>have spoken</a> toward those same ends—that trend is likely to continue.
</p><p>
	Counties that move to a machine-free alternative will gain confidence in the election process and results and set a positive example for counties that follow. Meanwhile, our legislators can at any time draft election legislation to remove electronic voting equipment. Or maybe a lawsuit similar to the one filed in Arizona on April 22, 2022—which seeks to ban ballot-counting machines—could succeed in Minnesota.
</p>
<h2>The Role of Secretary of State</h2>
<p>
	What happened in 2020 (and in the preceding decades) should never be allowed to happen again. As Minnesota's next secretary of state, I will make sure of that.
</p><p>
	<strong>Going forward, your voice and vote will count, perhaps for the first time in your life.</strong>
</p><p>
	This past year, I've worked with and learned from local and national grassroots leaders including some of the very best in the fields of cyber security, networks, law, and information warfare, to be well equipped for the road ahead.
</p><p>
	This all being said, the failed and corrupt political establishment's time is up. Days are numbered for rigged machine systems that install uni-party Democrats and uni-party Republicans. It would be an honor to serve you in public office alongside many other grassroots servant leaders who have already stood up and stepped onto a path to truly get results in Minnesota.
</p><p>
	Among the Minnesota secretary of state's responsibilities are chairing the State Canvassing Board, convening Minnesota's electoral college, and serving on the Executive Council and Board of Investment. But perhaps the most important responsibility is <strong>the administration of Minnesota election law</strong>, including strict adherence to critical statutes such as <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57" target=_new>206.57 EXAMINATION OF NEW VOTING SYSTEMS</a> and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.121" target=_new>203B.121 BALLOT BOARDS</a> and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/204B.44" target=_new>204B.44 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS; REMEDY</a>.
</p><p>
	I will get to know county auditors and city and township officials to carry out free, fair, and 100% auditable elections (not the risk-limiting audits currently used, but <italics>full and complete</italics> audits of ballots, machines, servers, and databases). If any county commissioners send me <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/motion-passed-to-request-minnesota" target=_new>a resolution in favor of an audit in their county</a>, as happened in Crow Wing County in January 2022, I will do the right thing. If counties <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.58" target=_new>opt out of electronic voting machines</a> (e-poll books, tabulators, and election management systems), I will connect them to experts capable of setting up counterfeit-proof paper ballots which can be hand-counted in precinct on election day and immediately audited by anyone casting a vote. I will take advice from local experts on major amendments to the statewide voter registration system (SVRS) and make it transparently available to the public to reduce or eliminate ready-to-launch voters.
</p><p>
	What can you do? Perhaps most important is that you stay as informed as you can while continuing to ask questions. The powers that be don't like when we <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gb7dgx2v9t5du25/ES%26S_FOIA_Request_CVR.pdf?dl=0" target=_new>submit FOIA or public data requests</a>, show up at county commissioner meetings to share evidence, or otherwise use our first amendment rights, but if we don't hold those in public office accountable, who will? We are the people we've been waiting for. Put on the full armor of God.
<strong>
	Join me in reclaiming the government for We the People.
</strong>
</p><p>
	If you do decide to vote for me and we are still relying on electronic voting machines for the Primary (August 9th) and the General Election (November 8th), please cast your vote in-person at your precinct on election day. If enough of you do this, there could be a chance to overwhelm the algorithms.
	</p><p>
	If possible I would have run for office with no party affiliation, especially after learning about evidence of <a href="https://saveminnesota.org/" target=_new>election tampering</a> in the MNGOP precinct caucuses. The secretary of state's responsibilities should obviously be non-partisan. However, since it is not possible when running for secretary of state in Minnesota to have no party affiliation, I will run as a republican.
	</p>

<h2>What Led Me Here</h2>
<p>
	This is my seventeenth year living in Minnesota, although my family returned to Stevens County each year in my youth from Texas, Gabon, Louisiana, Indonesia, and China, where my dad's work as a geophysicist brought us. After college, I worked four years in the inventory and software divisions at Target in Minneapolis before investing in myself as a freelance writer for the past eight years. I've assisted governors with a USA Today article and a military veteran with his autobiography, cowrote several books, one a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and helped about 90 authors choose the title of their book.
</p><p>
	With a growing understanding of what happened on November 3rd, 2020, life took a turn. After working with grassroots Minnesotans seeking audits, I attended Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. There I met people like Draza Smith, Seth Keshel, Mark Cook, and Col. Phil Waldron and also learned from people like Sean Smith, Patrick Colbeck, Joe Oltmann, and Professor David Clements. Here in Minnesota, I've continued to absorb much from people like Rick Weible and Susan Smith, as well as from those attending county commissioners meetings in Crow Wing, Dakota, and Sherburne County. Several dozen more men and women could be listed to whom I am grateful.
</p><p>
	These experiences and relationships were vital in preparing me to not only make the decision to run for Minnesota Secretary of State, but also to become the servant leader necessary to resolve our election problems, preserve election integrity, and restore confidence to all Minnesota voters that their <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/constitution/" target=_new>constitutional right to vote</a> (and to not be disenfranchised of that right) is fully protected.

<strong><small>No Donations</small></strong>
	<p>I will <strong>not</strong> be accepting donations. This is a grassroots movement where everyone can do their part by saying and doing the right thing to preserve election integrity for all Minnesotans. We are the news now: share this page, spread memes, and show up to your county commissioners meetings with other men and women who want to end rigged machine elections. Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door shall be opened.
	</p><p>
	And yes, by all means become an election judge, but realize that role will not allow you to monitor the election management system or servers or databases capable of manipulating results. Only removing those systems from use prevents that vulnerability from being exploited. Do not wait for the election itself to try to change the election process. As was shown in Nye County, Nevada, the electronic voting equipment can be removed county by county. We do not know how long or hard the struggle will be, but our combined voices and actions, God willing, may lead to lasting change.

To see how it works, simply <a href="https://projectapario.com/search?search_query=minnesota" target=_new>search for "Minnesota"</a> which runs a query against 630,000 records and delivers the 740 pages in the collections with "Minnesota" detected in the optical character recognition text output.
