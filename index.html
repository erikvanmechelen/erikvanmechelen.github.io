<h2 id="Overture">Overture</h2>

<p>For the last 15 years I have wondered what draws me to Diplomacy. Why do I love it? What gets me excited to play? How does the game produce in me an amazing state of flow? What is so interesting about post-game analysis with fellow players?</p>

<p>The gaming marketplace offers many good and even great games. And yet playing face to face Diplomacy is hard to match.</p>

<p>Why? How does Diplomacy, played over the board against six other humans, set itself apart?</p>

<p>Maybe it is because of how closely Diplomacy mirrors important elements in our lives. We live in a world where cooperation towards goals is useful yet requiring negotiation and value creation. But even among the best minds and with the best available technology, this collaboration doesn’t seem to be open-ended, at least not in the time-boundedness of our short lives, and at least in the context of material resources or things. (In a mutual, careful, and unbiased pursuit of truth in a striving for better outcomes, I believe we can be aligned in an open-ended way.)</p>

<p>Diplomacy too is constrained, time-bound, and rife with limitation. If thought of as a story, it is character-driven. Whether Sultan or Czar, each player struggles uphill, essentially alone.</p>

<p>When I paused to reflect on the game, I realized something:</p>

<p>The game of Diplomacy asks me as a player to have <a href="#Philosophy">a philosophy</a> of Diplomacy. This goes way beyond how I value solos, draws, and survival, or how I approach playing each great power, or even how I negotiate with collaborators and competitors.</p>

<p>Indeed, beginning to ask this question moved me from ‘How do I get better at Diplomacy?’ to ‘How do I become a better Diplomacy player?’ </p>

<p>The difference is subtle, but crucial.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re entering this book hoping to become better at Diplomacy. I know how that goes. </p>

<p>I remember drawing England in one of my first games. My fascination is immediate: England is great! Fleets are amazing! I might have soloed if France doesn’t stab me in 1904. Then I get a turn as Germany, and think: England is nice, but Germany is way more fun–I get to influence <em>everything</em>. A few months go by and I’ve applied some opening theory I read on diplomacy-archive.net. <em>Oh wait</em>, I realize, Italy is actually halfway decent…if only I have the patience and the skill to control the speed of the game.</p>

<p>Maybe you see what is missing there.</p>

<p>Before I make the reveal, and to provide an additional example by analogy, let’s look at a similar journey I took in college: my attempt to get better at poker. </p>

<p>With a background in live poker in high school, I tried my hand online. I learned the fundamentals and started winning at low stakes. Time to move up, but when I struggled at mid-stakes, instead of figuring out why, I try heads-up instead. Ahhh, there’s so much freedom in heads-up, and my bluffs actually work! Again, I have mild success at small stakes, but meet headwinds at mid-stakes. Books, articles, and hand histories showcase my technical and tactical leaks. Next I get a heads-up-display to monitor live stats (so I can play more tables profitably) and play 6-8 full ring tables at a time. I’m doing okay, but the urge to play heads-up returns. Decent win-rates at low-stakes gives me confidence to approach and actually have moderate success at mid-stakes. Time for high-stakes, right? Well, worth a try. My results suggest something is sorely missing.</p>

<p>I didn’t have a philosophy of poker. I didn’t have a good model of what poker was, nor how I wanted to play within that landscape of possibilities. Dan Harrington, one of less than a handful of people to make back-to-back final tables at the WSOP, explains that poker is a game of wagering.<sup id="fnref-Foo1"><a href="#fn-Foo1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This may not strike you as anything close to a philosophy of poker, but it was better than my vague ideas about poker at the time.</p>

<p>Part of what I’m doing in this book is encouraging myself (and you) to formulate and develop a philosophy of Diplomacy. (For what it’s worth, doing this exercise seems to help in other areas of life, too.) Once I have the beginnings of a philosophy, I can walk more confidently on the path to being a better Diplomacy player. Perhaps you’ll join me in this adventure.</p>

<p>If asking oneself “What is my philosophy of Diplomacy?” doesn’t, after a few measures of silence, produce within you a response, give the following a good try instead: </p>

<aside class="exercise_blurb blurb">
    <h4 id="leanpub-auto-ask-yourself">Ask yourself:</h4>

  <p>What sort of game is Diplomacy, really?  </p>

  <p>Given that, what combination of attributes, skills, and mentality would I expect are required to be successful as a player in that game? (Particularly in face to face Diplomacy.)  </p>

  <p>Too hard? Try these slightly easier ones:  </p>

  <p>What are my lifetime goals within the hobby? (What is Diplomacy to you? An interest, a hobby, a passion, a calling?)  </p>

  <p>What characteristics do I respect in an opponent?  </p>

  <p>If I hold grudges against a certain opponent, for what reasons do I hold them?  </p>

  <p>What reputation would I ideally have as a Diplomacy player?  </p>

</aside>

<p>Answering these questions suggests underlying beliefs and values, and hint at the model which you have constructed for what Diplomacy is and represents for you.</p>

<p>My responses to these questions are provided in the Chapter on <a href="#Philosophy">Philosophy</a>.<sup id="fnref-Foo2"><a href="#fn-Foo2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>  </p>

<p>You might read this and think, as my wife does, that all this is a bit dramatic. After all, Diplomacy is a just a game. </p>

<p>But some things are more than just games. </p>

<p>I doubt the Diplomacy hobby and community persists because there is “just a game” there. There is something about the preparation for, the experience of, and aftermath of a good game (or tournament) of Diplomacy that enlivens all of our spirits. Especially when played face to face.</p>

<p>It is with this–ahem–spirit, that I come to write this book.</p>

<p>I know all too well I am not alone in many of these sentiments. We have the tremendous privilege to play Diplomacy. It may well also be our responsibility to enjoy it, as well as to strive to uncover what secrets it may yet hold for us.</p>

<p>Whether you are with or against me, let’s press on (into the English Channel).</p>

<p>Shall we?</p>

<p>Please be aware: this book will have mistakes. Those are mine. I wrote the bulk of this book at a fever pitch across a few short days in between other projects (I write for a living). If there are good ideas within these pages, they are very likely other people’s. To me, that I might draw from other’s experience and knowledge is the benefit of a good culture, and the Diplomacy hobby seems to have a good one.</p>

<p>My sincere wish is to join the chorus of voices already carrying on the discussion about Diplomacy, whether for sheer joy, to move the hobby forward, or to enhance the overall standard of play. </p>

<p>With luck this won’t be the last book I or anyone else writes about the game.</p>

<p>May we all mistrust any certainties we have about Diplomacy. In this way our mutual exploration might continue yet another 65 years hence from its humble origins 65 years ago.</p>

<p><em>May we all make a small drop in the ocean, since what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?</em><sup id="fnref-Foo3"><a href="#fn-Foo3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="Adventure">The Adventure Begins</h2>

<aside>
  <h3 id="leanpub-auto-youve-been-invited">You’ve been invited…</h3>

  <p>…to play Diplomacy</p>

  <p>Lucky you.</p>

</aside>

<p>Diplomacy is one of those rare games that is a perennial favorite among a certain class of gamers: social, strategic, competitive. </p>

<p>How you’ve managed to avoid an invitation for so long may or may not be your fault. The world has gone a bit soft of late.</p>

<p>Amazingly, 65 years after its invention by Allan B. Calhamer, it has a prominent place in the hobby gaming landscape, from recreational to competitive play. From it’s face-to-face roots to postal heyday to online play and back again to face-to-face, Diplomacy has shown incredible staying power. </p>

<p>Of these vibrant roots I was unaware on my first contact with the game.</p>

<p>I was introduced to the game at Cypress Creek High School in Houston, Texas by my history teacher, Bill Self.</p>

<p>Though they did not know each other, game designer Larry Harris concurs with Mr. Self’s decision to bring the game into the classroom: </p>

<p>“I am convinced that Allan Calhamer’s masterpiece should be part of every high school curriculum. Don’t tell the kids, but it teaches history, geography, the art of political negotiation, and something else, some healthy critical skepticism. By the time you get into high school, you have a pretty good idea that not everyone always tells the truth. But a good game of Diplomacy helps you to understand how skillful some people can be at fooling you!”<sup id="fnref-foo4"><a href="#fn-foo4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In my first game of Diplomacy, I drew England. </p>

<p>It was a fall afternoon in 2003. The previous week, Mr. Self had asked for volunteers to play a game which he described favorably: “It’s a beautiful game.”</p>

<p>His intention was to teach some of us the game so that the quality of the forthcoming in-class game (for a grade!) would be of a higher standard. Smart man. (I highly valued this demo game, and <a href="#Exploration">describe later</a> how to involve new players in them.)</p>

<p>In this practice game as England, I quickly learned the advantages of fleets, how to prepare a successful convoy, and even took Saint Petersburg in 1902 from a distracted Russian.</p>

<p>That afternoon I was hooked. When I arrived home, I promptly ordered my copy, Avalon Hill’s 4th edition from the year 2000, a quality board I still own and occasionally use (even though I prefer playing with wooden pieces).</p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">

    <figcaption>This board isn’t bad either, at Saint Olaf College.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Leading up to the in-class game in Houston, I invited friends over on weekends to play. Mom made us cookies as well as healthy snacks to keep our energy levels high enough to sustain long, intense afternoons of strategic negotiation. </p>

<p>By the time of the in-class game, many of us were ready. </p>

<p>We understood the inherent <a href="#Inequality">Inequality</a> (Chapter 2) of the game, its delightful imbalances and the diplomatic nuances stemming from these dynamics and potential.</p>

<p>Having experienced growth, decline, victory, and defeat, we gained an understanding of <a href="#Psychology">Psychology</a> (Chapter 3). Now we had psychological strategies to deploy on ourselves and tools with which to engage our opponents and predict their behavior. I am looking forward to sharing what I think about the myth that to be successful in Diplomacy you must lie and deceive with some regularity. There is tremendous psychological power in truth-telling, and I will explore the role of truth in Diplomacy at some length.</p>

<p><a href="#Morality">Morality</a> (Chapter 4), too, you might be surprised to hear, has a place in the notoriously treacherous hobby.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until recently, having read an article on non-routine problems<sup id="fnref-foo5"><a href="#fn-foo5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and revisiting a book on the philosophy of poker<sup id="fnref-foo6"><a href="#fn-foo6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> that I began thinking about developing a <a href="#Philosophy">Philosophy</a> of Diplomacy (Chapter 1). My earliest musings will be shared, hopefully to be expanded in further writings.</p>

<p>Of course, our group of young Diplomacy players also planted seeds in the gardens of <a href="#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> (Chapter 5), <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a> (Chapter 6), and <a href="#Exploration">Exploration</a> (Chapter 7)–that is, an exploration of how to teach the game of Diplomacy.</p>

<p>I went on to win the in-class game as Germany opening with the <strong>Skagerrak Sentry</strong>, whose move order is equivalent to the Jutland Gambit, but which varies <em>diplomatically</em> in the sense that Germany and France are already planning to carve up England. An elaboration is given in the chapter on <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a>.   </p>

<p>Soon after, I started a Diplomacy Club within the high school, which had twice-weekly order adjudication. I remember daydreaming about my moves and then trying to find people in the hallways between classes to squeeze in a short negotiation. One day I wrote on a scrap of paper I managed to preserve: “Diplomacy is taking over!” Recently, my wife got a kick out of that, too. (Of course this is all part of my plan to get her and her friends to join our games at the Minnesota Diplomacy Club!)</p>

<p>As we reclaim useful leisure<sup id="fnref-foo7"><a href="#fn-foo7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>, seek meaningful social interaction, and equip ourselves to solve problems in the real world, Diplomacy will only rise in popularity. This game started in Allan B. Calhamer’s dorm room, face to face with friends. It went postal. Then online to the judges. And back around again to tournament play and face to face club games.</p>

<p>Even though I lived in Gabon, Indonesia, and China, my home is now in Minneapolis, Minnesota. And although my immediate attention is on developing the hobby here, I see no reason why the hobby should not continue to bloom elsewhere.</p>

<p>May you join this latest renaissance of the perennial favorite. </p>

<p>As Douglas Kent wrote in the 140th edition of Diplomacy World:</p>

<p>“This is a hobby of people, after all. The personalities, the friendships, the laughs, the time spent together is what transforms it from a game to THE GAME.”<sup id="fnref-foo8"><a href="#fn-foo8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>To celebrate Diplomacy’s persistence, I invite you to read and share what is useful in this book. </p>

<p>But first, perhaps, you should read it. Sharing it without reading would be like persistently bouncing in the Black Sea. <em>Mostly</em> pointless.</p>


<h2 id="Philosophy">Chapter 1: Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the past year or so I’ve adopted the view that I might take more responsibility for how things are going in my life than I’ve previously done.</p>

<p>This was and continues to be difficult. One constantly sees the mistakes, frailties, and flaws. Regrets are psychologically painful. This stresses the body and mind in a dangerous feedback loop (much like the one that saw Italian strategy in the doldrums for decades). But if you look long enough into the abyss, there is something to be found. In filth it will be found (In sterquilinus invenitur).<sup id="fnref-foo9"><a href="#fn-foo9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Literally, if you eat shit for awhile, you <em>might</em> learn something. No guarantees, though, and that’s the gamble of F Den-SKA in Spring 1902.  </p>

<p>While I tried to take on the model that everything I do matters, the reality was different.</p>

<p>The reality, right now, seems more like a super-position of a) everything I do matters, and b) things don’t matter as much as I think. </p>

<p>Perhaps I’ve taken this position as a result of scoring somewhat above average for Neuroticism on the Big 5 personality assessment (I am more affected than average by negative emotion): I have to protect myself <em>somehow</em>. Thus, the super-position of things mattering and not mattering. As I learn to <em>let go</em> of perceived mistakes, learn from them, and move on, I hope I will be able to shift the way I act in the world more toward ‘everything I do matters’. </p>

<p>If everything I do matters, and it feels like I should spend more time playing Diplomacy, and becoming a better Diplomacy player, then I better have a working justification for that.  </p>

<p>The prospect of creating this framework is tricky, because in developing a philosophy of Diplomacy in conjunction with this intent, I <em>could</em> let intellect and reason weigh in more than they should. Just as trying to describe the true experience would require a novel-length after-action report, there is danger in trying to summarize too neatly the path I’d like to walk.  </p>

<p>It isn’t obvious that playing more Diplomacy coincides with living my best life, but nor is it obvious that England should open more regularly to the English Channel.  </p>

<p>There is a case to be made that how I approach life should be agnostic (or irrelevant) toward building a philosophy of Diplomacy, or in developing a plan to become a better Diplomacy player.  </p>

<p>And then there is the fact that I am writing this book. Sometimes leaps of, can I say ‘faith’?, are necessary.  </p>

<p>In either case, this is partly why I begin with questions. This way at least I don’t make the first bad move of the game.  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-diplomacy-as-ritual">Diplomacy as Ritual</h3>

<p>Let me take a moment to comment on the hobby. </p>

<p>For decades now enthusiasts have met in garages, gardens, and grand hotel conference rooms to play a game of Diplomacy. Or better still, to participate in a tournament.</p>

<p>For the most part, these events are self-organizing. Sure, it helps to have a strong core of skilled event planners, passionate recruiters, and tournament directors among them, but these events have largely gone on with very little if any advertising and promotion. </p>

<p>As is impressed upon in Maps of Meaning, we act out and ritualize before we explicitly understand or are able to codify in language what we know. <sup id="fnref-foo10"><a href="#fn-foo10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Diplomacy is a version of this acting out. From one lens, Diplomacy is a ritual of several kinds of negotiation: conflict resolution, creative problem solving, trust and relationship building, distribution of resources, a handing out of mercy or justice, sacrifice, collaboration and competition in an environment of scarcity, to name but a few.  </p>

<p>These are all very good for the deepest parts of ourselves…for negotiation is always what we are doing, in a sense…we are always aiming, calibrating our aim, taking in new information, and getting others to join us in taking aim yet again at the next target.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-pennies-a-simple-version-of-the-game">34 Pennies: A Simple Version of the Game</h3>

<p>There are 34 pennies on a wooden table.</p>

<p>7 people are here, too. </p>

<p>Each person holds 3 (or 4) of the 34 pennies (the Russian gets 4). The remaining 12 pennies are scattered on the table’s grainy and uneven surface. </p>

<p>The game is to persuade the others to let you have 18 of the 34. </p>

<p>Already, this is a pretty interesting game. How will you divide the 12 unowned pennies? And, once that feat is completed, how on earth will you persuade the others to give you their pennies, particularly the shiny ones!</p>

<p>This basic model, of course, leaves out the territorial and resource component of the game.</p>

<p>Once we integrate the spatial relationships and economy, we get the constraints of positioning, logistics, and tempo. Unlike poker, in Diplomacy I cannot go completely on tilt and dump 8 pennies into your waiting hands. We would both have to be in position to make such an exchange, and other players are unlikely to allow it.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-a-relationship-with-the-game">A Relationship with the Game</h3>

<p>I’m still in the process of figuring out what Diplomacy and being a Diplomacy player means to me. Where on the continuum of recreation to competitive do I position myself? </p>

<p>This question remains unanswered.</p>

<p>One parallel I have drawn is this:</p>

<p>In the fall of 2018 I made re-acquaintance with a negotiations expert throwing around the idea of writing a strategic negotiations book. I took interest. </p>

<p>Less than a month later, I noticed a Minneapolis Meetup for Diplomacy. I had wanted to but failed to play face to face Diplomacy since I was 16 years old, and had recently retired from competitive soccer. Like two prerequisites for a good stab, the position and timing were good.</p>

<p>Ben Johnson and Jake Langenfeld held a great game, showing generosity to new players and a good game flow. I had fun. And although I rose to a 9-center Russia, my temptations ruined my patient early game. Nevertheless, I was hooked again.</p>

<p>I played a few more face to face games in late 2018 and in early 2019, in what is now the second season of the Minnesota Diplomacy Club, of which I’m a council member. I asked the Club President, Ben Johnson, what his hopes were for the club, and when he responded “I want this club to be the best Diplomacy club in the world”, I was persuaded.<sup id="fnref-foo11"><a href="#fn-foo11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-asking-the-right-questions">Asking the Right Questions</h3>

<p>If you haven’t attempted the questions posed in the <a href="#Overture">Overture</a>, give it a go. Unlike Spring 1902 tactics in the Balkans, I can all but guarantee the exercise will illuminate insights within you. Shine enough light, and from enough angles, and breakthroughs are possible.  </p>

<p>What sort of game is Diplomacy, really?</p>

<p>Given that, what combination of attributes, skills, and mentality would I expect are required to be successful as a player in that game?</p>

<p>Then, try these slightly easier ones:  </p>

<p>What are my lifetime goals within the hobby? (What is Diplomacy to you? An interest, a hobby, a passion, a calling?)</p>

<p>What characteristics do I respect in an opponent? </p>

<p>If I hold grudges against a certain opponent, for what reasons do I hold them?</p>

<p>What reputation would I ideally have as a Diplomacy player?</p>

<p>Answering these questions suggests underlying beliefs and values, and hint at the model which you have constructed for what Diplomacy is and represents for you, and how you play within that space.</p>

<aside>
  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-early-responses-to-hard-questions">Early Responses to Hard Questions</h4>

  <p><em>What sort of game is Diplomacy, really?</em></p>

  <p>A negotiations-driven allocation of scarce resources.<br>
 Or, perhaps: a negotiation-based psychological struggle for territorial influence.  </p>

<p>I will need some more time to craft why I might hold grudges as well as what my ideal reputation would be.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-problems">99 Problems</h4>

<p>Did you really expect to meet <em>no</em> resistance on your way to an 18-center solo. Of course not. (Getting to 6 centers is often a challenge in itself!) </p>

<p>Problems, or, as some prefer–puzzles–are inherent to Diplomacy. A position is on the board. And it poses problems to you. </p>

<p>Then there are your fellow diplomats, who will bring their own challenges. Personalities, emotional reactions, unusual negotiation strategies, gimmicks, unnecessary misdirection, the list goes on. You are like a business operator constantly putting out fires. Even when you can effectively manage one problem, sparks fly on other borders. </p>

<p>May I ask what you would do if none of these problems existed? </p>

<p>But you already know the answer: You wouldn’t be playing the game of Diplomacy. Without the nearly insurmountable challenge of navigating six other humans, each with non-aligning end-goals to your own, each with varying levels of skill and approach and style, the game would not be engaging. A diplomacy <em>player</em>, however, relishes each of the plentiful categories of problems he may face. Positional, relational, strategic. Usually each of these, all at once. </p>

<p>Here again we see Diplomacy’s mirroring of life. If we had no problems, would we really enjoy ourselves? Maybe for a short while, but most likely not for very long. We are not far from beasts of burden. Show me a burden and tell me which hill I need to climb.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-further-discussion-and-writing">Further Discussion and Writing</h4>

<p>Clearly, I need more experience, time, and conversation with other Diplomacy players to develop these ideas and considerations. </p>

<p>I hope, in the meantime, that you carry on your own adventure in developing a philosophy of Diplomacy. It might just help you become a better Diplomacy player. </p>

<p>Additionally, in future writings I’d like to comment more on the abstract building blocks and relationships of what Diplomacy is as a game. Who knows, this may help us extract new insights about the game and what we are doing here. Just like people don’t really have ideas (ideas have people), I fear that we may not be playing Diplomacy: Diplomacy may be playing <em>us</em>. </p>

<p>Last but not least, I am curious to understand more about mindset and attitude. While I may discuss these in <a href="#Psychology">Psychology</a>, I wonder how much these derive or interact with a player’s philosophy of Diplomacy.</p>


<h2 id="Inequality">Chapter 2: Inequality</h2>

<p>What does an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent being lack?  </p>

<p>Such a being lacks <em>limitation</em>.  </p>

<p>Limitation is perhaps the underlying factor that makes life beautiful.  </p>

<p>As humans, hand in hand with our limitation and fallibility we gain freedom and creativity. Perhaps also the need for work and sacrifice.  </p>

<p>In games, too, constraints hold within themselves the seeds of creativity.  </p>

<p>Inequality is a result of distributed limitations, and inequality is sown into the very fabric of Diplomacy. This design, I’m going to argue, is essential to what makes Diplomacy so captivating.  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-why-the-game-does-not-end-after-1901">Why the Game Does Not End After 1901</h3>

<p>Let’s imagine for a moment…</p>

<p>Each Great Power collects their neutral supply centers.</p>

<p>And promptly calls it a day. </p>

<p>After all, shouldn’t they be happy? They’ve all gained something. The Frenchman and German could settle into an armchair somewhere in the Low Countries and admire the elegance of the English fleets over a glass of champagne. The English sailors may well wave back. </p>

<p>But…no.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t happen, would it? </p>

<p>Here, the game of Diplomacy continues. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Despite our occasional sloth and laziness, it is not in our human nature to rest indefinitely. We want progress. We need to do better, get better, and get <em>more</em>. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-the-map-and-the-territory">The Map (and the Territory)</h3>

<p>One of my favorite game designers, Will Wright, famously referenced <em>A Pattern Language</em><sup id="fnref-foo12"><a href="#fn-foo12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> in preparing the code for Simcity 2000. </p>

<p>Mr. Calhamer, in preparing The Game of Diplomacy, sought to mimic the historical position of the seven great powers in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The design architecture is true to historical and geographic realities, creating a lovely imbalance.  </p>

<p>Not unlike a dynamic chess mid-game, or a delicate local-global position in Go.  </p>

<p>Here though is one of the game’s major advantages: Diplomacy players need not wait for the mid-game to pique their interest, as Diplomacy’s opening positions suggest the flaws inherent in human nature and showcase the potential of unique combinations of strengths. </p>

<p>Each power’s offensive and defensive prospects, territorial influence, and overall tecture inflect their player’s diplomatic starting point. But as in the game of life, what a player does with his shake of fate’s die is up to him. How you will you move what <em>is</em> toward what <em>should be</em>?</p>

<p>Given the unequal starting positions, what <em>should be</em> your objective? More on this in <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a>.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-spatial-relationships">Spatial Relationships</h4>

<p>When I first discovered Douglas Crockford’s Diplomacy map, it changed the way I looked at the game. Simply put, Mr. Crockford’s map gives less attention to the geographical shape of Europe and more attention to the relevant spacial relationships in the game itself.</p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">

</div>


<p>When I asked for permission to reference his map, Mr. Crockford quipped: “Do what you like. I think the map had a bigger impact on you than on the world.”</p>

<p>Perhaps we can change that. </p>

<aside>
  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-what-might-we-learn">What Might We Learn?</h4>

  <p>Notice how spatial relationships seem to differ between a standard Diplomacy map and the Crockford version.</p>

  <p>Which territories seem to gain in significance? Which are diminished? </p>

</aside>

<p>I’m not suggesting that the Diplomacy map presents a visual illusion. But perhaps it <em>disguises</em> otherwise easily understood relationships. For instance, it requires the same number of moves (2) to bring an army from Paris to Spain as it does from Armenia to Moscow. Likewise, a fleet going from Belgium to Kiel requires the same number of moves (2) as a fleet going from Tunis to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>After seeing how the pieces move, it is clear that a great distance might be traveled in only 2 or 3 moves. However, because of unit density (and not to mention strategic and diplomatic requirements), those 2 or 3 moves may take much longer than 2 or 3 seasons to enact. Furthermore–and this is another aspect of unit density and the rule of one-unit-per-territory–it often requires <em>several</em> units in coordination (through supports, support-cutting, or convoying) to successfully move a unit to a new territory. </p>

<p>As I gained experience in the game, it was interesting to learn where the board tended to be heavier or lighter, to understand which spaces held strategic importance, and how various territory’s significance <em>could</em> shift as alliances crumbled or new targets were taken on.</p>

<p>Having designed a couple or three of my own board games (as yet unpublished), I can only imagine the play-testing required to arrive at the current texture, shape, and harmony of the board. The dynamics it creates are wonderful to behold, and even better to experience. The opening phrases of Spring 1901 are but the first signs of melodies which develop into a great symphony; the waves of music unfurl as each iteration of the game plays out.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-fleets-and-armies">Fleets and Armies</h4>

<p>In my first game of Diplomacy, I drew England and came to know the power and versatility of fleets.</p>

<p>And then I played my first game as Austria, and understood armies better.</p>

<p>Then came Germany, and the tradeoffs between the two were even better understood.</p>

<p>Fleets and armies do not represent equal strengths. Sometimes a fleet is stronger. Sometimes an army. As will be discussed in <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a>, your units overall cohesion–how they work <em>together</em>–matters greatly. The strength of a unit usually relates also to the specific territory it occupies, as well as those territories adjacent to it. As in Go, where a stone placed adjacent another stone removes a liberty, it also removes a liberty of its own. Two adjacent units may provide support or cut support.</p>

<p>On the topic supports: a fleet’s support may not be cut by an army. But an army’s support may be cut by a fleet. In conjunction with a convoy order, armies can move a good distance and, even if they bounce in their destination, may still cut a support there.</p>

<p>Convoys, of course, are a luxury provided by fleets. And, in certain tactical situations, are safer plays than standard attacks. Consider the following convoy to Norway.</p>

<p>A tremendously overlooked strategic aspect (at least by newer players) is influencing where your opponents may build diplomatically <em>and</em> tactically. For example, if France has opened F Bre-ENG, he may sometimes get England to cover London (with A Yor-Lon or F NTH-Lon) and prevent a build of Fleet London in Winter 1901 adjustments. (So long as France doesn’t meddle too much with the English player’s head, France can justifiably argue that the Englishman has done this to himself.)</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-players-are-unequal">Players are Unequal</h3>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-experience-personality-and-standard-of-play">Experience, Personality, and Standard of Play</h4>

<p>Have you played as Germany before? What’s your experience in an English-French alliance? Have you successfully navigated the Balkans as Italy? </p>

<p>Are you playing with novices? Former World Champions? Are you playing with someone capable of misordering? What about a World Champion capable of writing a misorder (intentional or not)?</p>

<p>Your opponents will vary in general Diplomacy knowledge in the areas of dynamics, logistics, strategy, tactics, and negotiation. </p>

<p>Each will potentially have relationships with other players. Perhaps there are soft or strong allegiances to clubs or friends. Maybe players have history against one another.</p>

<p>This is more a discussion for <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a>, but it will not hurt to study a player’s historical record. At minimum, a complement on an opponent’s past record will create avenues toward trust and perhaps establish evidence of your competence (even though it merely suggests your ability to perform basic research).</p>

<p>Maybe your opponent has a reputation. Heaven forbid, maybe <em>you</em> do. How strongly do you perceive your opponents to be accounting for this in today’s game?</p>

<p>Finally (but this is far from exhaustive), each player arrives to the game with differing philosophies, personalities, and expectations. </p>

<p>Remember, over the course of enough games, each Diplomacy player will get to play each power a reasonable number of times. This may take awhile (Matthias, a member of the MN Diplomacy club, is still yet to play a Western power across 16 games). As in poker, where eventually you will be dealt a relatively even distribution of hands relative to your opponents, you will <em>eventually</em> get to play as each great power. </p>

<p>Given this knowledge, across a set of games, your goal might be to do better than most other players across each country. It seems likely that this conclusion led Diplomacy Clubs and tournament organizers to offer Best Country awards, recognizing the inequalities and also the reality that a given player will not get a chance to play all countries in a short space of time (whether a series of club games or a tournament). </p>

<p>How you use your read on players’ varying skill, experience, and style of play, will prove handy in devising your <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a> and approach to <a href="#Negotiation">Negotiation</a>.</p>

<p>Next up is a brief discussion of <a href="#Psychology">Psychology</a>, which is followed by <a href="#Morality">Morality</a> before diving headlong into <a href="#Negotiations">Negotiations</a>.</p>


<h2 id="Psychology">Chapter 3: Psychology</h2>

<p>An understanding of psychology is integral to your success in Diplomacy. Especially face to face Diplomacy.</p>

<p>The best players have a feel for their opponents’ playing styles, motivations, and intended actions. They know what to ask their opponents when they notice inconsistencies or hesitation, and they know how to ask those questions. </p>

<p>These nuances have been discussed elsewhere, and perhaps will find their way into a subsequent book. This further discussion of might include opponent modeling, player expectations, and behavioral motivation.</p>

<p>For now, and in this book, I want to focus on these areas: </p>

<p>The psychological power of the truth.</p>

<p>Forecasting.</p>

<p>The value of persistence.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-game-theory">Game Theory</h3>

<p>Risk…etc</p>

<p>Game theory is a branch of decision theory focusing on interactive decisions, applicable whenever the actions of two or more decision makers jointly determine an outcome that affects them all.</p>

<p>Diplomacy is not a game of chance, but it is a game where chances have to be taken. </p>

<p>Risk without dice? Sort of, but not really. I wouldn’t compare Risk to Diplomacy in this manner, because a description misses important mechanisms and flavors of both games.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-spring-and-fall">Spring and Fall</h3>

<p>In Spring we take our chances, and in Fall we hunker down for winter.<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>If you take a</p>

<p>More risk seeking on gains. </p>

<p>More risk averse on losses. </p>

<p>Prospect theory.</p>

<p>Players make mistakes defensively because they are overly risk averse.</p>

<p>Here’s a new Turkish player’s mistake I witnessed. Notice how he holds in Ankara to avoid the Russian F Arm-Ank, but allows Russia to take the Black Sea combined with A Sev-Arm!</p>

<p>IMAGE</p>

<p>If the Turk was to consider the situation from the Russian point of view, he would hold <em>less</em> of the time. </p>

<p>Russia knew he was a new player, and understood that if he could gain the Black Sea and Armenia, he could force Ankara in the next year. Armed with this perception, he would only try F Arm-Ank <em>seldomly</em>, and only when he had suspicion that this very new player would notice the attack that was coming the next season after Russia took the Black Sea.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-fleets-and-armies-this-section-is-also-mentioned-in-inequality">Fleets and Armies (This Section is also mentioned in INEQUALITY)</h3>

<p>In my first game of Diplomacy, I drew England and came to know the power and versatility of fleets.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-our-relationship-to-the-truth">Our Relationship to the Truth</h3>

<p>There is psychological power in truth-telling. Just <em>knowing</em> when someone is telling the truth matters. And is comforting. (Especially when everyone else seems to be lying.) </p>

<p>To build on this, I would also like to discuss the myth that you must lie or deceive to be successful in Diplomacy. </p>

<p>There is incredible psychological power in the truth. There is a myth that you have to tell lies or you have to deceive to win at Diplomacy.</p>

<p>Even though lies and deception are effective, as they are in real life, they are not the <em>most</em> effective approach. </p>

<p>What is effective is inspiring confidence through truth-telling. Making good plans that benefit two or more players (including yourself), and following through forthrightly on those plans. </p>

<p>Now, Diplomacy is a strange game in some ways. Notwithstanding my <a href="#Overture">Overture</a>, perhaps it is a little “zero-summy” for my liking. As someone who believes in value creation through discussion and exploration of interests and creative problem-solving, it is disappointing at times to see only 34 supply centers available on the map, no matter how long the game runs.</p>

<p>But we need not deceive or stab so long as we are open with collaboration partners. Some players prefer to refer to their collaboration partners as allies. This may not be an accurate categorization. Can you really be an <em>ally</em> in a race to 18 of 34 supply centers? Maybe you can be a temporary ally, you might argue. And that might be a good argument to have sometime. </p>

<p>I’d rather go forward with the open intention that I am going for 18 centers. I expect you to have that aim as well. In that sense, we cannot be allies. But the fact that we cannot be allies certainly does not prevent us from mutually working toward valuable goals, diminishing our targets and advancing our causes.</p>

<p>At some moment there is a pivot point at which our collaboration, if our individual goals remain to achieve 18 centers, is less profitable than a shift to other collaboration partners offers.</p>

<p>It is in this way that the truth remains a very powerful approach, even in Diplomacy. </p>

<p>One player I’ve observed at length albeit at a distance–through Chris Martin’s video series of the WDC 2016–is Andrew Goff. I challenge you to find areas where he is not forthright in his negotiations. (I haven’t played with him, so those who have will be able to attest better than I.) When he is leaving himself open for a stab, for example, he confronts his neighbors to encourage them <em>not</em> to do so, with good reasons and psychological persuasion. </p>

<p>It is a thing of beauty to watch, and I suspect it is no accident he has done so incredibly well at major tournaments, including winning three world championships. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-forecasting-neither-slave-nor-tyrant">Forecasting: Neither Slave Nor Tyrant</h3>

<p>Would you rather be a slave or the tyrant? </p>

<p>It turns out, you may be one in the same, or both simultaneously.</p>

<p>Let’s begin internally: who or what is making your decisions? How are you deciding upon a course of action. Certainly the objectives of the game are involved. Going for a solo or setting yourself up for a board top in a draw, and so on. Your emotions certainly have their sway too. We are quite good and backwards reasoning from emotional conclusions. We aim, then make up stories about why we are doing those things.</p>

<p>We are slaves and masters to varying layers of…<em>ourselves</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to learn about cognitive biases all humans share, you might start with Daniel Kahneman’s <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, or the paper he wrote in 1974 with friend and colleague Amos Tversky, ‘Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases’.</p>

<p>But actively applying your newfound knowledge may prove difficult. After all, just because you know what biases you have doesn’t mean you can notice them at all times (nor do you need to). Even Mr. Kahneman acknowledges as much, and often, including recently in a live conversation with Sam Harris. <sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Our System 1 takes care of most decisions while System 2 is only brought to bear occasionally. But, if we can get beyond what Kahneman called ’What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI), or what Tetlock calls ‘tip of the nose thinking’, then we can begin to employ strategies in overcoming cognitive biases when and where they matter.</p>

<p>Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner have given us an interesting way to practice doing so in their book, <em>Super Forecasting</em>. In their story about a relatively small group of super forecasters who beat IARPA’s own government-backed researchers in a tournament of geopolitical forecasting, Tetlock and Gardner provide a blueprint for beginning one’s own journey of forecasting better than the average human (or at least better than you yourself do now).</p>

<p>Their results were impressive and their knowledge sharing is generous.</p>

<p>Useful here may be the practice they suggest of asking questions to narrow one’s attention. </p>

<p>For instance, you might ask: How likely is it that England will attempt to stab me, given this position? </p>

<p>Now, you may have an intuitive response to that. Which may include what <em>you</em> would do, what the position suggests, as well as your current relationship in this game. But that isn’t the whole story, is it?</p>

<p>What about these questions: </p>

<p><em>What evidence do I have that England will stab me?</em></p>

<p><em>In the past, when I have been stabbed by England, how was his demeanor towards me?</em></p>

<p>And so on. </p>

<p>If you do come to the conclusion that there is a considerable possibility of being stabbed, and there is still time to negotiate, you may do well to have a discussion about it. You may be able to sniff out the stab and persuade the Englishman to at least delay this decision. </p>

<p>This way you will not be slave to the stab nor allow the tyrant in you to stab first. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-disbelief-in-your-own-ability">Disbelief in Your Own Ability</h3>

<p>Should you really split the difference at the bargaining table? </p>

<p>I argue that often, you shouldn’t. </p>

<p>It feels like we lost when we walk away from deals, but that is only a psychological safety net built into us. You have to notice that feeling and let it go, at least sometimes.</p>

<p>Other times, you need to persist in influence opponents. What interests of theirs are you not acknowledging? Why, at the very bottom, is an opponent not seeing value in the reasons you bring? Keep searching. Stay attached yet not overly attached to a plan, especially if there is mutual value to be had. After all, you both can see the board as it is. You both see what potential there is before you. </p>

<p>Sometimes, though, in a long game of Diplomacy, we fall into a rut. We think: I can’t believe that a creature as useless as me could bring anything useful to the world.</p>

<p>Of course, this line of thinking misses something important. It fails to account for the amazing capacity you have to do better. The <em>potential</em> of your inner strength, creativity, and resourcefulness. </p>

<p>Whether at 2 centers or 12, you have the opportunity–and the responsibility–to play a great game. At least do it for the other players, if not for your own sanity.</p>

<p>Have the courage to stay in the arena. The adventure always lies ahead if you can be awake enough to notice the path.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-chain-sickness">Chain Sickness</h3>

<p>Closely related to this mental dip is the following sentiment:</p>

<p><em>Even once you’ve rid yourself of chains, you may yet retain the chain sickness.</em>  </p>

<p>Nietzsche argued that an individual who has succeeded in emancipating himself from the Church, may still, deep down, experience the chain sickness. Supposedly this led to his writing of <em>Thus Spake, Zarathustra</em>, although my scholarship on the philosopher is very limited. </p>

<p>What I have felt is a feeling of displacement and attachment to that which is no longer there. This happened when I left corporate America about five years ago, and lingered for a few years. </p>

<p>It is also felt in a haptic sense. If you wear a piece of jewelry, such as a ring, and take it off at day’s end, it often feels as though you were still wearing it. When you go to touch it, you find it isn’t there. It’s not there, so what exactly were you feeling? </p>

<p>Stubborn as I can be, I have felt this way about a failed plan in Diplomacy.</p>

<p>Abandoning plans is hard. But taking on new plans requires you to let go.</p>

<p>Playing the best game you can demands it. </p>

<p>There is hesitation, because there was something you <em>wanted</em> to be right about your previous course of action. If you take on a new course, you will be admitting you didn’t know something, or worse, that you were wrong. It’s no fun to be wrong. And to have to admit that to others is hard. </p>

<p>But if you can admit where you were wrong, you potentially gain a huge edge in Diplomacy. </p>

<p>“I miscalculated.”</p>

<p>“I made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I left myself open to that stab.”</p>

<p>These are statements that take on responsibility (instead of eschewing it). To my mind, a player who honestly makes these admissions is in a better mental state to coordinate moves over the board. He is less likely to let emotions imbalance him going forward. Leaving aside the value of stoking a player’s emotional reaction to events, hearing this kind of language is level-headed and helps me feel confident about making clear plans with this player.</p>


<h2 id="Morality">Chapter 4: Morality</h2>

<p>Does morality really have a place in a game of intrigue, deception, and underhanded dealings?</p>

<p>I put to you that, yes, it does. </p>

<p>In his essay, <em>Lying</em>, neuroscientist and philosopher Sam Harris argues that “Lying is the royal road to chaos.”<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> In a discussion of lying’s short and long term consequences, Harris recounts the socratic conversation carried on between he and his professor in a college course entitled ‘The Ethical Analyst’ where the question <em>Is it wrong to lie?</em> was discussed for the entire semester.</p>

<p>The author came away “convinced that lying, even about the smallest matters, needlessly damages personal relationships and public trust.”  </p>

<p>Is it possible not to lie throughout an entire game of Diplomacy, and still do well?</p>

<p>Surely it is, although such a feat may require careful omissions and avoidance of various topics with collaborators-cum-targets. When you put the knife in, and explain to your former ally that you never lied to him, he probably will not let you off the hook for the stab. </p>

<p>It is common, too, to see top level players use phrasing akin to “let’s talk about that in the spring” or “I think that conversation is premature” to either reframe discussions, delay them, or avoid having to lie. </p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve used similar conversation tactics yourself.</p>

<p>From this perspective, we can already see that agreeing to answer a question you don’t want to answer, and answering it in such a way that will soon reveal you to have lied, is not such a great decision in many scenarios. </p>

<p>Even in a game where lying is permitted, we don’t want to be known as a player who frequently lies (at least who frequently lies unnecessarily). </p>

<p>We might amend the initial claim as follows: It is possible to do well in Diplomacy without lying, but deception and misdirection and the element of surprise are required.  </p>

<p>We will cover these deceptions in the context of a discussion on morality as well.</p>

<p>While lying is an area where our moral sensibilities about how to act in society actually map on reasonably well to the game of Diplomacy, there are a few other areas where they do not. These categories will be discussed as well.</p>

<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it (at least Aristotle stated as much). May you entertain the ideas in this chapter. Afterward, you may discard them.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-lying">Lying</h3>

<p>In the introduction to <em>Lying</em>, Harris discusses the difference between outright lies and deception. For instance, he discusses the wearing of cosmetics, the hurried person pretending not to notice an acquaintance passing in the street, or a polite host not calling out a guest’s silly statement in front of others. In these cases, Harris argues, we are skirting the truth, but at least we do not “deliberately manufacture falsehood or conceal important facts to the detriment of others.”<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<p>Here is a definition of lying: <em>to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.</em></p>

<p>Does this let Diplomacy players off the hook? </p>

<p>Perhaps. </p>

<p>Such a definition surely gives us pause to think over how lying affects the relationships between players, the overall approach to the game, and from a larger perspective the affect of lying on the game of Diplomacy in general.</p>

<p>It is arguable whether at any moment in the course of conversations with other players that one should <em>expect</em> honest communication. </p>

<p>Perhaps a progression of a Diplomacy player with respect to lying goes like this:</p>

<p><strong>The Naive Diplomacy Player</strong>: Expects honest communication, most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>The Cynical Diplomacy Player</strong>: Expects to be lied too often.</p>

<p><strong>The Courageous Diplomacy Player</strong>: Expects honest communication, most of the time, and stays alert to cues he is being lied to. Doesn’t enjoy being lied to, and occasionally uses being lied to as punishment for the liar as well as leverage with other players.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a> and <a href="#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> I’ll argue that the best face to face players are mostly operating as <strong>Courageous Diplomacy Players</strong>, communicating honestly on the whole, expecting that from others. In other words, such players are consistently extending hands of trust. If they were not, they wouldn’t be so ticked off when they are lied to.</p>

<p>There is a larger discussion to be had around knowing the situations in which one may be lied to. </p>

<p>Generally speaking, watch out for lies in strategically pivotal moments of the game.</p>

<p>As to how to notice these, continue reading into the chapter on <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-deception-and-misdirection">Deception (and Misdirection)</h3>

<p>Here we might return to a discussion of lying versus misdirection. </p>

<p>Sewing seeds of doubt in a player as to the intentions of his ally is regarded as good strategy. And often necessary. </p>

<p>Is this even deceiving? Only, it seems, if you are aware of what each individual in the pair of allies is actually thinking. That’s hard to do be sure of, isn’t it? In this case, your suggestion and planting of seeds of doubt may actually be accurate information. Yes, you are doing such a thing for your own strategic advantage, as is the case for almost everything one does in a game of Diplomacy.  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-spectrums-of-the-moral-compass">Spectrums of the Moral Compass</h3>

<p>A sense of right and wrong guides nuances of my negotiation tactics. Player preferences and sensibilities may allow one player to take an action that another would frown upon. The fact that the second player frowns upon it (even if the tactic is not strictly disallowed in the rules of Diplomacy) suggests a moral question. </p>

<p>For someone of my temperament, who perhaps values honor and integrity slightly more than average, the action taken by the first player (should I learn of it) may devalue in some–however small–way my future interactions. This may hurt me in future games, or it may help. It is all very hard to say, as various other factors might influence those future interactions and games.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-norms-in-face-to-face-diplomacy">Norms in Face to Face Diplomacy</h3>

<p>Are there norms that generally guide face to face Diplomacy? Here are several I have noticed, observed, or actively discussed. </p>

<p>Perhaps listing potential Norms gives a place to evaluate how morality affects the game. If indeed, it should at all.  </p>

<p><em>It is not okay to deceive the Game Master (GM)</em></p>

<p>Unless agreed upon by the players pre-game.</p>

<p><em>Lying, deception, and misdirection are generally within bounds.</em></p>

<p>As discussed, needlessly lying generally isn’t a good long-term strategy.</p>

<p><em>Players should write their own orders.</em></p>

<p>Part of the enjoyment of Diplomacy is writing one’s <em>own</em> orders. Sure, another player may assist you, or even influence you. But a player should not be (or allow themselves to be) persuaded or coerced into having another player write their orders for them.</p>

<p>A larger discussion might then be had around taking <em>ownership</em> for the game before you, and the responsibility one has to play as well as they can within the context of available options, outcomes, including meta game.</p>

<p><em>Players should finish games they start.</em></p>

<p>Giving up is a psychological pitfall we all have, and must avoid. Diplomacy can appear ruthless, but taking things personally may diminish your ability to perform well, especially in cases where secondary goals must be adopted to survive (when you have become a target). </p>

<p>Outright leaving or quitting a game should be avoided. It ruins the fun for the rest of the board.</p>

<p><em>Competition and collaboration are encouraged.</em></p>

<p>Diplomacy involves both, separately and at the same time. </p>

<p><em>Kingmaking is acceptable.</em></p>

<p>Especially on Top Boards, Kingmaking is acceptable, although players differ on whether it is good strategic play or not. (Since Kingmaking is acceptable, the <em>threat</em> of Kingmaking becomes a reliable threat diplomatically.)</p>

<p><em>Throwing a game is acceptable.</em></p>

<p>Here we have another area where views differ.</p>

<p><em>Spying is acceptable.</em></p>

<p>Listening into another’s conversation is acceptable. I may prefer, from an etiquette standpoint, that you approach me and ask for a word, but if I am speaking very loudly and you happen to hear me from across the room, that is probably my fault for speaking to boisterously. (Watch out: maybe I wanted you to hear me.)</p>

<p><em>Illegal retreats should not be tolerated.</em></p>

<p>In games on the clock, illegal retreats are sometimes mis-adjudicated, but these are frowned upon given the Diplomacy rules.</p>

<p><em>If someone reveals their orders during order writing, that is on them.</em></p>

<p>In poker, if while checking your cards I see them, I tend to notify the player and suggest they keep their cards to themselves. </p>

<p>In Diplomacy, I follow this same etiquette. I can’t disremember what I saw, but I can inform you of your carelessness for the future.</p>

<p>In tournaments using a drop-dead clock, this likely does not apply.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-assessing-your-moral-sensibilities">Assessing Your Moral Sensibilities</h3>

<p>Where do you stand on questions of right and wrong in a game of Diplomacy? Have you ever wavered, by your <em>own</em> standards?</p>

<p>What would you do if you saw an order you weren’t meant to see, 10 seconds before orders are due? </p>

<p>If you could get away with it, would you attempt an illegal retreat? </p>

<p>What is most interesting to me is the discussion around lying, deception, and misdirection. Why do some players applaud incredible and elaborate lies while others frown upon their apparent effectiveness? Why are erratic truth-tellers described as both fun to play with and inviting a target upon their backs?</p>


<h2 id="Negotiation">Chapter 5: Negotiation</h2>

<p>Negotiation is perhaps <em>the</em> skill required to be successful at Diplomacy. Especially face to face Diplomacy.</p>

<p>Paying attention and engaging with your negotiation counterparts is crucial to gaining and transmitting information. To make plans, to achieve them. To spot lies, deception, and misdirection. How something is said matters as much–usually more–than what is said. What is omitted, perhaps greater.</p>

<p>You’ll notice omissions in this chapter. We’ll discuss those in the next book.</p>

<p>Let’s get on with it.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-north-korean-weapons-technology">North Korean Weapons Technology</h3>

<p>One of my college entrance essays discussed Diplomacy and black holes. (The other was about Samwise Gamgee’s loyalty.) I was asked about the Diplomacy and black holes essay by the professor of International Relations at Saint Olaf College, from whom I later took my first every college course. </p>

<p>During that course in my freshman year, I was to feature in a fictional role-playing of the Six-Way talks. I was representing North Korea. My objectives sheet had some interesting near and long-term goals, including securing foodstuffs as donations from the United States whilst maintaining our research and development of nuclear technology. I remember using my negative leverage–continuing to develop nuclear weapons technologies–to garner additional concessions from my negotiation counterparts. </p>

<p>I remember asking the American representative what would happen if I continued to develop my nuclear capabilities. The individual’s face betrayed the <em>very negative</em> outcome associated with her objectives sheet, but she went on to effectively attempt to dissuade me of my proposed plan. </p>

<p>Of course, this was a little too late. I could see that my negative leverage was quite a bit stronger than her positive leverage. And that, as the negotiations grew tenser and our timing tightened, I didn’t need to make concessions to achieve my best outcomes. </p>

<p>This was an early example in understanding the value of interests, the reliability of threats, and the likelihood of future concessions.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-telling-a-vivid-story">Telling a Vivid Story</h3>

<p>Telling a story that is to be readily believed requires emotional and cognitive resonance. Will other players accept the story you provide for your beliefs? Does it mesh <em>enough</em> with what they believe about the state of the board, the relationships of players, the potentials for growth? </p>

<p>Can you fit <em>into</em> the story they are telling themselves about the game? </p>

<p>For example, you can make an extreme prediction (with little evidence) so long as it fits into the story your counterpart currently has about the game space. </p>

<p>Often, players will use a conclusion from a certain set of an opponent’s moves to argue for collaboration with their neighbor. When the optics of a move suggest a plan, this plan (whether intended or not by that player), can quite vividly be wrapped into a story serving your own needs. (Nevermind that the other player may not be the type to so overtly announce himself with such overt moves.)</p>

<p>If someone is spinning a story, I like to check the validity of my counterpart’s claims by asking questions like: </p>

<p>“Is that really what his moves are saying?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t he have other aims besides those?”</p>

<p>Notice how these questions can be used agnostic of the position. Even if you don’t understand a position strategically (or are actually onboard with your counterpart’s story), these questions will demand a response (or a reaction) from your counterpart. This way, you can discover if your conversational counterpart will stick to his story or dilute his story to account for your doubt. You will occasionally cause a glitch in the dubious frame your opponent is drawing. Good for you, in that case.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-intuition">Intuition</h3>

<p>In a comparative history course my senior year at Saint Olaf College, I assumed the role of an Athenian athlete. I named my character Philokrates–<em>friend of power</em>–after reading my objectives in the ancient Greek role-playing game, <em>The Threshold of Democracy: Athens in 403 BCE (4th Edition)</em>.<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">17</a></sup>  in a separate political science course, wherein I convinced the Athenian assembly to grant me power of the military (which I promptly used to assume control of the city-state). Perhaps they shouldn’t have trusted me.</p>

<p>What the other students lacked–I think–is an intuition for how I would behave in this general context. Few if any had played competitive games with me, or role-playing games, or games of negotiation. For the most part, we had done what most students in college classes do, listen to lectures and occasionally engage in class discussions. Furthermore, the students had their own complicated objectives, and didn’t know to watch out for my hidden objective of using the army to take over the city-state.</p>

<p>As a Diplomacy player, you will develop various kinds of intuition. </p>

<p>The most obvious are those relating to interacting with people. These you will probably come armed with. Most people are reasonably good at spotting discomfort or quirks or ticks in our fellow humans. If you’re not, perhaps look for a <em>lack</em> of comfort in your own feeling. If you are feeling very good, you may have good rapport and good general reason and evidence for continued or future cooperation. </p>

<p>Next, we will have intuitions about negotiation and how a negotiation <em>feels</em> when it is proceeding effectively. If either party becomes defensive, <em>that</em> is the signal something has gone wrong in a previous portion of the negotiation (or in the hidden objectives of either party). </p>

<p>Finally, an intuition about a position will eventually develop over the course of enough games. When I see F MAO and F SPA(sc) I often feel uneasy on behalf of the English. When Germany builds Army Berlin, I’m concerned for Russia (and perhaps England, too, if France is still on the map, as the build seems pro-French). </p>

<p>These intuitions may be less reliable than we might think, since we humans tend to be results-oriented over small sample sizes. For example, when I played my first ten or twenty thousand hands of poker, I developed bad habits in cases where my mathematical mistakes <em>paid off</em> in the wrong way. Of course, I needed to go back and fix those habits later, which was difficult to do. </p>

<p>You may have had a bad experience as Turkey with the Russian in the Black Sea, or as Austria with the Russian in Galicia, whereas another player may have performed much better than you in those same positions for a variety of reasons below the surface-level position. </p>

<p>These lower level intuitions, however, are useful in that they provide mental heuristics to jump-start planning. If you are able to “read” a board quickly, then you will have more time for negotiating ideas and plans. You will also be able to weigh offers and collaboration proposals more accurately in real-time without needing to refer back to the board or calculate 2 or 3 seasons ahead. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-anticipatory-regret">Anticipatory Regret</h3>

<p>There are things you’d like to do, such as exercise, which you know you will not have done enough of 10 years from now. </p>

<p>Even now, you already can feel a little regret having not done them. </p>

<p>All it took was for you to read those words, nod your head, and <em>there</em> is the regret. </p>

<p>This in effect is an exercise in counterfactual thinking.</p>

<p>Let me put this to you from a Diplomacy perspective. </p>

<p>“You don’t want to end this turn on four dots.”</p>

<p>OR </p>

<p>“Will you feel good if he takes the North Sea from you?” </p>

<p>These kinds of questions should put in mind the likely counterfactual bad result, but also they may trigger anticipatory regret. <em>No, I won’t like it if he takes the North Sea one bit!</em> your English counterpart may be thinking, in response to your question about the German fleet in Helgoland Bight. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-appeals-to-fairness-and-center-count-parity">Appeals to Fairness and Center Count Parity</h3>

<p>Because of the natural <a href="#Inequality">Inequality</a> in the game of Diplomacy, it is rare to find a game where multiple powers are on the same center count. Usually, one or two powers have an edge. Even though everyone knows that everyone else is trying to get to 18 (or at least more than he has at the moment), an appeal to fairness can be effective in several ways. </p>

<p>When negotiation collaborations, ask: “Is it good for us if England goes up 2 and we both stay even?” OR “What happens if Austria goes down 2?”</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-collaborative-language">Collaborative Language</h3>

<p>I learned to watch out for the aggressive use of ‘we’ when I read Christopher Hitchens’ <em>Letters to a Young Contrarian</em>. Who exactly is using this ‘we’ and how did you become wrapped up in it? More than likely, your counterpart is using this language so as to maintain rapport with you, or a relationship, or an expectation. This could be a promising signal.</p>

<p>Maybe you can use this language yourself. </p>

<p>But be careful. <em>Overusing</em> ‘we’ like this feels off, at least to some players. Many people want to maintain autonomy over their actions. If you’re negotiation with me, I want you to occasionally ask me, “What do you want to do?” or “What do you want to happen?” Even if you have adversarial ideas, this is probably more effective than overusing ‘we’, since at minimum you are acknowledging my existence as an autonomous individual, and secondly, you are asking questions about my <em>interests</em>. These interests can be used to better negotiate with me moving forward, both as positive or negative leverage.</p>

<p>The last paragraph withstanding, speaking in a collaborative manner to maintain a positive relationship tends to be taken favorably by a certain category of player. Using ‘we’ and ‘our’ should probably be a <em>part</em> of your conversational repertoire.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-what-you-measure-matters">What You Measure Matters</h3>

<p>The strength of a position is not explicitly measured in a game of Diplomacy. No metric exists to say that Russia, even though he is only on 5 centers, actually has very good winning chances in this position. </p>

<p>It takes a mixture of intuition, calculation, and persuasion to make such a case. If you <em>are</em> the Russian on 5 centers with a dynamic and high-growth-potential position, you may at times downplay this. Your opponents, if they understand a positional advantage that you’ve achieved, may attempt to make this “fact” (or story) vivid in other players’ minds. </p>

<p>Consider the following scenario. </p>

<p>You’re Russia on 5 centers. You’ve lost Saint Petersburg to England, but have a fairly good relationship with the Prime Minister and have seen to it that he is entangled with France and Germany. The West is balanced in a favorable way for you, because you are focused for the moment in the south. Maybe your preferred medium or long-term partner is Italy in this game, but you’ve positioned yourself for advances in either Austria or Turkey. </p>

    <img src="images/goodrussia5.png" alt="A strong Russian position." style="width: 100%;">
    <figcaption>A strong Russian position.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>I haven’t even mentioned your fleet in the Black Sea yet, which is pretty amazing. I might even be happy in this position on four centers (without Rumania). </p>

<p>Maybe I’m overvaluing the Black Sea. But maybe I’m <em>undervaluing</em> it. I might even be happy with a 3-center Russia if I have the Black Sea.</p>


<h2 id="Strategy">Chapter 6: Strategy</h2>

<p>When asked what is needed to prosper in Diplomacy, many players think of Strategy and Negotiation first.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, I will not bore you with what has been discovered already in the 65 years of the game, but rather with insights and speculations that hope to build on what is known, so as to stretch us into the unknown. </p>

<p>We will, as convention suggests, also touch on Opening, Mid-game, and End-game theory, though my country-specific strategy will be quite limited. I’ll aim to ask questions in lieu of offering solutions. </p>

<p>The mistake I’d like to avoid: offering a solution before a problem is properly defined.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-when-do-you-write-your-orders">When Do You Write Your Orders?</h3>

<p>Each turn, you have numerous possible orders for your collection of units. For example, Germany’s starting position alone offers over 1,000 options. True, not 1,000 viable options, but variety nonetheless!</p>

<p>How will you decide? What decision tree are you following to make the best choices? </p>

<p>We will begin this chapter with a discussion of five dimensions which should help to narrow your good options. </p>

<p>As was recently shared with me by the MN Diplomacy Club president, Ben Johnson, European players tend to write their orders first, then spend the negotiations period persuading others of their plans. Americans, meanwhile, have ideas about what they want to do, but generally do not put their orders on paper until having discussions.</p>

<p>Merits to writing orders first: one can focus on actively listening, identifying areas to offer assistance, bargaining for influence, prying for more information, and otherwise enjoying the pursuit of affecting the board in conjunction with your own best set of orders. </p>

<p>You also avoid the dreaded No Move Received (NMR) where all your units Hold.</p>

<p>Merits to writing orders after having diplomacy with other players: one can attend to problems and plans posed by other players without being overly constrained by your own predefined move-set. </p>

<p>A happy medium: Writing a few good order sets and crossing out those that turn out not to be viable later. Depending on how you think, this may be too much information to handle…what if you cross out the wrong orders? There is the added downside of revealing to the reader of the orders the crossed out orders, though this is a minor psychological concession (most of the time).</p>

<p>Either way, developing an understanding and framework for concepts like Pace (or Tempo), Shape (or Cohesiveness), Influence (or Pressure), Growth, and Targets will ease your decision-making concerns.</p>

<p>I highly recommend investing in this theory, especially if you are an analytical type who likes to weigh all his tactical options. The framework will more quickly get you into the negotiations arena, where you need to be to win the game. </p>

<p>(Additionally, you will know when an opponent is trying to sell you a bad plan.)</p>

<p><strong>Concepts</strong></p>

<p>Pace (or Tempo), Shape (or Cohesiveness), Influence (or Pressure), Growth, and Targets make up a five-dimensional framework which assist your negotiations.</p>

<p>In this framing, you might consider re-reading the the chapter on <a href="#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> after you read this one. The reason <a href="#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> comes slightly ahead of Strategy in priority is simply that, no matter how much you understand about the strategy of Diplomacy, if you can’t negotiate well, you stand little chance of succeeding.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-pace">Pace</h3>

<p>My Russian soccer coach once took our team to watch a game in Asia’s Tiger Cup. The game was held at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium. I don’t recall whether the game was between Indonesia and Thailand or Malaysia and Thailand, or none of these, but it doesn’t matter. My coach asked me to watch for one of the team’s strategy and report back at halftime. </p>

<p>That was fine by me. I settled into the hard plastic seat: soccer halves are 45 minutes long. Might as well get as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>But when a group of men sat down around us–remember, I was only fourteen or fifteen years old–and starting and never stopped smoking, it was hard to pay attention to the match. (This is where I laugh, recalling what a college friend told me years later as I avoided second-hand smoke: “You see Erik, that’s the difference between you and me–you’re trying to hold your breath and turn away, but me, well I’m trying to get a hit.”)</p>

<p>At halftime my coach turns around and asks: “So what’s their strategy?”</p>

<p>I drew a blank and my coach was disappointed. He made it sound so simple: “They’re playing an up-tempo <em>defense</em>. Whenever they lose the ball, they press their midfield and backs very high up the pitch. Of course this leaves them vulnerable at the back, if they are picked apart. But on the other hand, if they win the ball <em>back</em>, they will have scoring chances.” </p>

<p>We went on to discuss the merits and demerits of such a strategy. To play a high tempo defensive strategy, you need fit players that work hard for 90 minutes. You need a speedy back-line, because the opposing side may counter with long balls. If the opposing team is an excellent passing team, a high tempo defensive strategy will be less effective: the ball will ping about faster than even a cohesive group of defensive players can intercept or disrupt. </p>

<p>How does this relate to Diplomacy?</p>

<p>Each turn, your units have many options. Since your units occupying additional supply centers is the only way to advance in the game, you might reason that moving as efficiently as possible toward those supply centers (be they neutral or another player’s) is a good approach. </p>

<p>You wouldn’t be wrong. </p>

<p>But your reasoning would also not be <em>complete</em>. </p>

<p>Simply moving at high speeds won’t be effective in all situations. (Sing high when they sing low; sing fast when they sing slow.) If, as France, you are planning a side-door convoy into Liverpool in 1902 or 1903, you might do well to disguise your intentions so as to avoid a defensive build from England. </p>

<p>Consider that certain arrangements and territories on the board allow for great potential speed or flexibility, sometimes both. F MAO and F SPA(sc) can be sent north to prepare a convoy into Lvp or Wal as well as shifted east into Naf and WES to put two units adjacent to Tunis. </p>

<p>This very example actually represents a version of up-tempo defense, in the sense that F MAO and F Spa(sc) also may be used to guard ENG, Bre, Mar, and GoL. </p>

<p>Sometimes you <em>will</em> have to tradeoff all-out speed for effective speed. Common examples of this are any moves that avoid unneeded or undesired bounces. <em>Particularly</em> if you are planning a chain-move, a 50% chance or higher of the lead unit bouncing is quite annoying and a questionable gamble (if negotiations have not produced better odds). </p>

<p>In the image below, Russia and Austria have DMZ’d Galicia, but then Serbia has accepted Turkey’s support of A Ser-Rum. This move is disastrous for Russia, since the Czar also attempted to “guarantee” Rumania by giving up the Black Sea. Ouch.</p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 256px;">
    <img src="images/failedrussianchain.png" alt="A failed Russian chain move." style="width: 100%;">
    <figcaption>A failed Russian chain move.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>But do not be afraid of bounces, either.</p>

<p>For instance, assuring Rumania in Spring 1901 as Russia (F Sev-Rum) immediately gives up the Black Sea to Turkey, which could be quite uncomfortable as the game progresses.</p>

<p>Germany and France may arrange bounces in Burgundy for mutual defense, whilst bounces in Galicia are not uncommon. Somewhat less common are bounces in Spring 1901 by England and France, because those units do really have better things to be doing (if either player could be assured that the bounce was 100% going to take place).</p>

<p>Your builds will also very much effect your tempo. An army build in Berlin versus Munich (if even to disguise potential moves against France), has the demerits of Russia’s questions and slower tempo against France–for your sake, I hope the Frenchman does not strike first! </p>

<p>Builds should be considered greatly in your tempo considerations. If the board seems ready for a pivot, a misplacement could see you miss out on potential gains. </p>

<p>One final note on pace (for now): </p>

<p>Mind that you don’t grow too quickly and too fast, lest other players take notice (how will they not?). The first mover doesn’t always have the advantage.<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">18</a></sup> </p>

<p>Consider this, too: Avoid the first wrong move. Instead, look for the first right move. Act decisively once you spot it. Hat tip to Andrew Goff here whilst giving a post-game analysis of WDC 2016.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-shape-or-cohesiveness">Shape (or Cohesiveness)</h3>

<p>The modern-day National Basketball League (NBA) is all but dominated but pace and space offenses. If you can drive the pace and keep the floor spaced, you get easy buckets inside or wide-open three pointers. The Golden State Warriors took what the Pheonix Suns started in the Mike D’Antoni and Steve Nash era and, with the Splash Brothers in Klay Thompson and Steph Curry, changed the NBA. </p>

<p>The Rockets General Manager Darrel Morey has spoken about building his team (also coached by D’Antoni) to beat the Warriors at their own game. As of 2019, they have put shooters around the dynamic James Harden and sidekick Chris Paul in an attempt to outscore you. You may make a lot of 2-point shots, but when they are raining 3-pointers, the numbers don’t add up in your favor.</p>

<p>In Diplomacy, all armies and fleets are equal in the sense that they have an attribute strength of 1. However, armies and fleets <em>behave</em> differently. Situationally, armies <em>feel</em> like the power forwards and centers of the NBA, a strong inside presence. Meanwhile, the fleets can <em>feel</em> like three-point shooters on the wings, keeping a spacing that is difficult to defend. </p>

<p>Overall, I like to think of my mix of armies and fleets as a single dynamic unit or <em>character</em> with various attributes like strength, shape, or cohesiveness. As in Chess, it is usually better for your units to be able to support and work together, whether these be pawn chains or bigger pieces working together. </p>

<p>In coastal regions, armies and fleets work particularly well together (especially if your target has no fleets to cut <em>your</em> fleet’s support). Of course, in landlocked areas, a corps of armies can do well on attack and defense. </p>

<p>As is common in Chess commentary, where it might be noted that the knight on A3 feels misplaced, there is such a thing as a misplaced unit in Diplomacy as well.</p>

<p>What is an example of a misplaced unit? </p>

<p>In a recent face-to-face game I GM’d, Germany owned the North Sea and decided to convoy an army into England. This left him open to an (unexpected) Austrian attack on Munich from Bohemia. The Austria player shrugged. Munich was, after all, undefended. Seeing the German army convoy to Edinburgh only incentivized the attack. You might also say that Germany’s fleet in Kiel was misplaced in the sense that it offered no defensive assistance to Munich.</p>

<p>Units can be tactically misplaced, diplomatically misplaced, strategically misplaced, and so on. It is common for players to negotiate repositioning before being able to work together productively.</p>

<p>Every unit on the board will affect incentives and influence.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, paying attention to your cohesion and the mix of armies and fleets is critical. In the early game, build appropriately to maintain your cohesion, and do your best to anticipate your opponents’ builds as well. </p>

<p>If your pieces are working well together, you don’t <em>need</em> that many units to have great defensive and offensive prospects. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-influence-or-pressure">Influence (or Pressure)</h3>

<p>I am of the same mind of World Champions like Chris Martin who advocate England opening to the English Channel more often. England may worry he can’t guarantee a build if he both gets bounced by France <em>and</em> Russia opens A Mos-StP, but in a vacuum this combination of outcomes is both unlikely and foretells trouble in any event when it <em>does</em> occur.</p>

<p>Please, just open to the English Channel. At least a little more often. It’s not as anti-French as you may think.<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> </p>

<p>Certain territories–but really <em>any</em> territories your units occupy–exert a direct influence on neighboring territories. Supports can be given or cut. Moves into those territories can be made. And all of this <em>potentially</em> could happen. Bargaining chips and tokens. </p>

<p>If early game pace might be used for anything, keep an eye for the opportunity to occupy <em>influential</em> territories in a cohesive manner. Your early game center count is somewhat less important than your <em>potential</em> for growth and tempo. (For some powers more than others–Italy, for example, need not get to five centers immediately, although once Italy does, it becomes formidable.)  </p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 288px;">
    <img src="images/thisisdecentforengland.png" alt="For example, this is decent for England." style="width: 100%;">
    <figcaption>For example, this is decent for England.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Having your pieces in important positions, ultimately, provides leverage. The Frenchman wants your fleet out of the Channel. Your reply may be: “Sure, how about we land it in Belgium?” Then again, once you gain a deeper understanding of the game, you may value your fleet occupying the English Channel more than a dot that is Belgium (especially if that center becomes difficult to hold).</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-growth">Growth</h3>

<p>After the neutral dots have been collected or divided, how will you grow? Inevitably, you will have to take supply center from a neighbor. </p>

<p>But first, let’s discuss a theory of growth. </p>

<p>It is well documented that, for example, Germany and Austria do quite well when ending 1901 on 5 centers, but less well when ending on 6 dots. </p>

<p>How could this be? </p>

<p>The simplest idea seems best here. If a player has 6, it’s more likely neighbors have 5 or 4 (or 3), and this imbalance–or <em>unfairness</em>–tends to create good arguments to form coalitions against the 6-center power. In short, it gives players easy answers. If there isn’t already a villain, players have to work harder to create them.</p>

<p>Bear this in mind. Although if you <em>are</em> the Bear (Russia), getting 6 is completely fine–especially if Sweden was an offer from Germany for a few years of good relations whilst you sort out the south. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-targets">Targets</h3>

<p>Choosing a target in the early-, mid-, or late-opening is imperative to make progress. </p>

<p>Once you have a plan, persuade others to join you in it, and then carry out said plan. </p>

<p>But wait, how can I suggest all of this so plainly? </p>

<p>As has already been discussed at length in <a href="#Negotiation">Negotiation</a>, your ability to persuade others of your joint interests and plans to achieve them will be very important in taking dots off your targets. </p>

<p>There is a saying in poker: “If you don’t know who the fish is at the table, it’s you.” </p>

<p>In Diplomacy, if you don’t know who the target is, it’s you.</p>

<p>But what should each power’s early targets be? </p>

<p>Simply put, I believe targets should depend on several factors, including your read of who is a target of other players on the board. </p>

<p>If you do have an early-game target in mind, your aim may be to secure the neutrals whilst also establishing an influential or even objectively strong position relative to the potential target. This position, while dangerous looking to the target, should, with your diplomatic prowess, be manageable, while also giving credence to your requests for assistance against the target. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-secrets">Secrets</h3>

<p>There will be moments in the course of a Diplomacy game in which you uncover secrets. These may be secrets of your opponent’s grand strategy, a secret about your collaborator’s psychology, or perhaps a secret about your own devious subconscious. </p>

<p>Now that you have uncovered this knowledge, will you make use of it? This is the first question, and not as easy as it sounds. As in the movie <em>Rounders</em> (where the protagonist spots a physical tell in his poker opponent), you may not want to reveal your knowledge of a valuable secret, if there are ways for you to exploit it quietly, in nominal ways, for a long time.</p>

<p>As is a general theme, do not make the first wrong move with your secret. Rather, make the first <em>good</em> move with your newfound knowledge. Marketing and sales is as important as the idea or product.</p>

<p>Maybe, after consideration, you decide to watch for moments to deploy this knowledge (to your advantage, of course). </p>

<p>If you do make use of it, how will you do this, and when, and under what circumstances? </p>

<p>Having a plan to deploy information such as this–your secrets–is critical. It allows you to be triggered by your pre-made plans and not have to constantly spend mental resources deciding whether to carry out a potential tactic or not.</p>

<p>I recommend using your secrets as discreetly as you can, but as powerfully as you can. </p>

<p>As with your general <a href="#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> strategy, putting other players on the defensive often will not free their own mental resources to create value on your behalf. However, if you have both leverage <em>and</em> a secret, the revealing of which may hurt your negotiations partner, positioning your “news” as a threat could be called for.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-theory-opening-mid-game-end-game">Theory: Opening, Mid-Game, End-Game</h3>

<p>By now you’ve realized I seem to approach things in reverse. Where one person starts with opening theory on page 1 of a Diplomacy Guide, in this manual opening theory gets short shrift until now. </p>

<p>But that <em>is</em> interesting, isn’t it? </p>

<p>By now you probably don’t even need to read this section. You’re quite possibly equipped to stand over the board and develop your own theory, country by country, season by season. I highly encourage you do. </p>

<p>After a few weeks, you can return here and see if I cause you to think anything new. Likely not, if you’ve thought clearly and carefully enough, without presupposition, and with enough imagination. </p>

<p>At any rate, to get to opening theory, you will have to fight through end-game and mid-game theory first!</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-end-game">End-Game</h5>

<p>Just as chess grand masters and nine don Go players have excellent technique in the end-game of their chosen fields, top Diplomacy players understand how to settle scores and mend broken alliances (if needed) to secure the stalemate positions that prevent further progress. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dipwiki.com/index.php?title=The_Gamer%27s_Guide_To_Diplomacy:_Stalemates">Key stalemate lines</a> are explained in several areas in the literature, including the DipWiki.</p>

<p>Depending on the format of your neighborhood, club, or tournament game, an understanding of these non-solo end-game positions provides additional strategic, diplomatic, and tactical considerations. Be sure to assess your opponents’ understanding of these positions. Late-game stabs that get you to, say, 13 or 14 centers, may strategically be <em>unsound</em>, but may actually get you to 18 if playing against incompetent opponents. Obviously, soloing isn’t as satisfying against newer players as against very good players, but it is a solo nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>Where</em> you’d like to position your pieces creates the need for plans to achieve those positions. For example, a Turkish army in Ukraine is extraordinarily powerful. But how will you actually get it there, and can you manage it while also maintaining good piece coordination and shape? </p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 288px;">
    <img src="images/turkishpathtoukraine.png" alt="A Turkish Army's Path May Vary" style="width: 100%;">
    <figcaption>A Turkish Army’s Path May Vary</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Option 1 above sees you breaking into Sev from Armenia. </p>

<p>Option 2 has you with F BLA providing a convoy to Rum or Sev. </p>

<p>Option 3 shows the long march through the Balkans.</p>

<p>Each path is viable, depending on your strategy, cooperation with Austria or Italy, and the potential timing of the attack against Russia.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-mid-game">Mid-Game</h5>

<p>For my money the mid-game is entered after one or more powers take considerable hits. The game flow may change as players assess the board position and potentially choose new targets. </p>

<p>Sometimes it is where players assume secondary goals. Watch these strategic and psychological transitions carefully. Yet another reason–but did you really need another?–to maintain a good speaking relationship with as many if not all players throughout the balance of the game. </p>

<p>Good diplomacy and solid tactics alone can get you into a decent early game position, but the mid-game is most fruitful for very good players who understand the where and how positions may shift. They are good and creating new avenues for growth, and for playing balance of power if their section of the board hasn’t progressed or consolidated at the same pace as other parts of the board. </p>

<p>If your pieces are cohesive and occupying influential positions, the mid-game becomes enticing indeed as multiple players may come to you requesting the service of your position. You may well be able to create value for them and for yourself. </p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-the-opening">The Opening</h5>

<p>I remember my first game of Diplomacy. (I remember almost all of my face to face games…I’m not sure why this is.) </p>

<p>I bet you remember yours, too. The European landscape, carved as it is into the shape befitting Allan B. Calhamer’s vision, is intriguing. Where should your armies march and your fleets sail? </p>

<p>Others have commented at length on the opening, including in 1970 Richard Sharp’s <em>The Game of Diplomacy</em><sup id="fnref-foo3"><a href="#fn-foo3" rel="footnote">20</a></sup> and more recently Andrew Goff’s blog on openings.<sup id="fnref-foo4"><a href="#fn-foo4" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> Note that Richard Sharp preferred an active game where all seven players played both strategically and tactically sound games. He seems to have preferred agreements to alliances, and so forth. Differing on some dimensions is a player like Andrew Goff, who in a preliminary round of the 2018 WDC as England opened A Lvp <em>holds</em> (naturally, to show the Russia with intent that the army will not be arriving in Norway in Fall 1901). </p>

<p>While it is very effective to understand how a power can achieve 18 centers, and work backwards from that destination to the opening, there are some differences to games (like chess) where this approach has more value. </p>

<p>In chess, the position tends to simplify over time as pieces are removed from the board. In Diplomacy, there will almost always be 34 units on the board. The changes are in the owner of those units, the mix of fleets and armies, their positioning, and whether they are available to coordinate with your own (if they are not owned by you). </p>

<p>Because an opposing player’s units always have the <em>potential</em> to support or attack your own units, the Opening in Diplomacy is slightly more critical than the opening in Chess or the first bet in a poker hand. Because the positioning of your units will continue to influence the position not only in the next season but probably years hence, those first decisions mean a lot. Pawn to E4 (Fischer’s “Best by Test”) can transpose into many openings, whereas F Ank-Con (while flexible), often gives up the Black Sea or suggests early-game cooperation with Russia. </p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-country-specific-strategy">Country-Specific Strategy</h5>

<p>I am largely going to avoid the area of specific advice country by country. Richard Gee has well pointed out that even among top players, there is considerable bias at play in country by country analysis.</p>

<p>Gee writes of Richard Sharp’s England advice, for example: </p>

<p>“The chapter on England for example, states “ENG at all cost!” and a close reading reveals that England and France must always be at war. In truth any serious opening against Ger. is omitted.  It would also appear that no mention is made of how England can arrange matters so that France / Germany end up in a fight over Belgium.  Furthermore there is no discussion on the concept of The Western Alliance. The only conclusion is that the author has seen to it that England has pulled her punches as far as Germany is concerned.”<sup id="fnref-foo5"><a href="#fn-foo5" rel="footnote">22</a></sup></p>

<p>I do not wish to impart similar misknowledge, nor, as will be discussed in <a href="#Exploration">Exploration</a>, do I wish to <em>steal your destiny</em> from you. Unlocking strategic insights in Diplomacy is largely an individual adventure, it seems. Top players like Andrew Goff seem to agree.<sup id="fnref-foo6"><a href="#fn-foo6" rel="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<p>So far in this book I have suggested on multiple occasions that England not relinquish the Channel early to France, but players like Steve Jones, commenting in an article published in ‘Richard’s Bull Run’ in May 1984, suggests that either Germany or Russia should be removed as a threat before focusing on France. It seems this discussion has been going on for a long time. And will continue to do so to all our delight. </p>

<p>Speaking of delight, let us now discuss the art of the stab.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-toward-a-philosophy-of-stabs">Toward a Philosophy of Stabs</h3>

<p>Much has been written about stabs. And rightfully so. </p>

<p>Stabs, as I first understood them, referred to cooperative or even tightly-allied players making an unexpected move against the other, usually at an opportune time, leading to supply centers exchanging hands. (In Richard Sharp’s line of thinking, if read a certain way, there is no such thing as a stab, since there are no alliances, only players making agreements to better their positions.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, these moves were coordinated with another player, suggesting a shift in allegiances, possibly warranted by the overall state of the board and usually aligned with the newly cooperating players’ long term objectives (usually, winning the game). </p>

<p>In this context, stabs are all but inevitable. For most great powers, it is difficult to solo (18 centers) without working against an early-game collaborator. The inequality of the starting positions establishes this reality. </p>

<p>Given that stabs are inevitable, continuing this line of reasoning, stabs need not be viewed negatively. Sure, they seem to have a negative outcome for the player stabbed, but that player should not <em>really</em> have been expecting the game to go on without one forever. </p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-valuing-stabs">Valuing Stabs</h4>

<p>From a numbers perspective, stabs that take 2 or 3 centers from another player are better than a stab which takes 0 or 1. If you go +2 and your opponent goes -2, that’s a 4-center swing. You’ve got 6-center swing if you go +3 and your opponent goes -3. </p>

<p>Depending on the center counts, unit placement, and prospects, </p>

<p>The player you stab will likely have to remove unit(s) from the board. Factor this into your pre-stab calculations as well. What kind of player are you dealing with? Will he remove units on your front, or from another player’s? Will <em>you</em> actually be the player to gain most from a stab in the medium term? (If you aren’t, the stab is highly questionable.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common mistake (beyond a failed stab), is not understanding how your stab will play out in the medium term (and long term). If in two to three years, a neighbor gains more than you, and you’ve created one or more enemies via the stab itself, has the stab truly succeeded? </p>

<p>Remember, the stab must help you <em>win</em> the game. If the stab merely gets you to 14 centers without real prospects for 18, then the stab might be premature. </p>

<p>(In tournament games or top boards with uncertain clock end times, there are caveats to the above.)</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-when-to-avoid-obvious-stabs">When to Avoid Obvious Stabs</h4>

<p>When you can’t get to 18, it’s probably not time to stab.  </p>

<p>It will be tempting though. </p>

<p>Perhaps you can practice avoiding temptation by realizing that, like the child who is offered a cookie now, or three cookies in ten minutes, that there is more to be gained with patience and sacrifice.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-invite-a-stab">How to Invite a Stab</h4>

<p>Because of the tactical, strategical, and psychological effect stabs have on the flavor and texture of the game, inviting a stab <em>against</em> you can be tremendously beneficial. </p>

<p>The key is, of course, is to understand how you will survive such a stab. </p>

<p>Then, if this is arranged, how the stab will be encouraged. </p>

<p>Finally, once the stab is made against you, the final piece is to market and sell that you indeed <em>have</em> been stabbed. </p>

<p>Once stabbed, you can likely gain the cooperation of neighboring players to save your game or to work together against the stabber. </p>

<p>Recently, Andrew Goff used such an early-game strategy as England to invite a stab and then subsequently work with France to dismantle the German (the stabber). </p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-risk-of-ruin">Risk of Ruin</h4>

<p>In discussions with my brother Mark relating to the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, namely Prospect Theory, a common topic is <strong>Risk of Ruin</strong>. Prospect Theory says we put a premium on the chance to avoid losses (versus a smaller sure loss) as well as pay too much to assure a gain (even when the expected value of a probabilistic wager is stronger). Kahneman and Tversky conclude that humans are irrational. You just have to trust me that I am not straw-manning their position here.</p>

<p>My brother Mark has little tolerance for the viewpoint that human beings are irrational, at least given merely this evidence. </p>

<p>For a living Mark created models to help traders better understand their overall risk. In his risk management models you could see which traders were betting more of ‘the farm’ than was prudent. This led to course corrections or discussions between those traders and their peers or management. </p>

<p>Let me present you a deal right now. </p>

<p>2/3 of the time, you win $1,000,000. </p>

<p>1/3 of the time, you lose $1,000,000. </p>

<p>Do you take it?</p>

<p>In a vacuum, you should take this bet <em>all day long</em>, and as many times as you are offered it. </p>

<p>The problem is, you aren’t in a vacuum. You’re in your life, with all the circumstances, obligations, and responsibilities it entails. </p>

<p>If you are only offered the bet <em>once</em>, there is a tremendous amount to consider here. </p>

<p>Even if your net worth was, say, $3,000,000, you’d be putting 1/3 of that net worth at risk right there. You wouldn’t be ruined if you lost, but ending up at $2,000,000 might hurt <em>more</em> than $4,000,000 felt good. </p>

<p>If you’re like me and your net worth is less than $1,000,000, then losing this bet puts you at a negative net worth. </p>

<p>In effect, your <em>risk of ruin</em> on this bet is 1/3. One out of three times, which is quite a lot!, you will have ruined yourself, your family, and everyone who depends on you. </p>

<p>I personally think that the idea of risk of ruin percolates into smaller and perhaps less life-altering wagers, and rightfully so. </p>

<p>For example, this concept of risk of ruin played out throughout my poker career, when I risked too much ‘taking shots’ at higher stakes than my bank account could tolerate. When I couldn’t buy back in at the higher stakes, I was ‘ruined’ at those stakes, and had to drop down to much lower stakes to rebuild my bankroll. </p>

<p>In Diplomacy, there are situations where your risk of ruin should affect your decision making. Having a sense for how it may affect your opponents’ decision making (if they are your targets), will also help greatly. </p>

<p>Against certain Italian players, for example, it may be too much of a risk to leave Trieste unguarded in Spring 1901. To have a chance at Greece, bargain for a DMZ in Galicia, send your fleet Trieste to Albania, and send Vienna to cover the vacated home center.</p>

<p>You can probably think of several more situations like this. </p>

<p>Examples include mid-game alliance stabs and overly zealous builds, like Russian fleet StP (nc) in Winter 1901, while there is still much to work out in the Balkans.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-what-do-gascony-and-livonia-have-in-common">What do Gascony and Livonia have in Common?</h3>

<p>Besides being featured in two of my favorite <em>interesting</em> openings, Gascony and Livonia are important spaces in the sense of providing defensive, offensive, and repositioning potential. These spaces are influential diplomatically, as well, when your units occupy them. </p>

<p>The Iberian Indecision (A Mar-Spa; A Par-Gas; F Bre-MAO) gives flexibility against both England and Germany and lets England and Germany scrap over Belgium. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Livonian Lunacy has its merits against an overtly troublesome German.<sup id="fnref-foo7"><a href="#fn-foo7" rel="footnote">24</a></sup> </p>

<p>Both Gascony and Livonia, though, are important mid-game territories. Consider Gascony, which can defend Paris and Marseilles, or be convoyed to Wales. Livonia can defend Saint Petersburg and Warsaw while also convoying to Kiel. Interestingly, on the other side of it, Gascony and Livonia are not unusual landing zones for English or German armies.</p>

<p>Apulia, Albania, Wales, and Yorkshire have a similar feel, with varying situational utility.</p>

<p>Now, instead of belaboring points that have already been made, I would like to take this opportunity to share one or two openings I like, <strong>The Skagerrak Sentry</strong> (for Germany) and then <strong>The Venetian Vanishing</strong> for an Austrian/Italian cooperation.</p>

<p>These are simply a few fun openings you might consider situationally. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-the-skagerrak-sentry">The Skagerrak Sentry</h3>

<aside>
  <h3 id="leanpub-auto-the-situation">The Situation</h3>
  <p>You were lucky and drew <em>Germany</em> in the final game of a 3-game tournament.
How will you open? </p>

  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-consider">Consider</h4>
  <p>England is a strong player. Russia, too. You’d prefer not to ally with either, however, as you need a 9 or 10 center result to have a chance at winning the tournament.
You happen to know France needs a big result, too. </p>

</aside>

<p>France’s desire to quickly gain centers makes him a natural early game ally in the carving up of England. But you need to ensure you get a bigger piece of England than France does. After England’s dismantling, you will have the opportunity to maintain your alliance with France to move on Russia OR to break through into the English Channel or Burgundy in an attack on France. </p>

<p>(You’ve opted out of the Sealion, since you don’t want to be too friendly with Russia and you’d prefer the edge over France in England’s spoils.)</p>

<p>Early diplomacy suggests Russia will have his hands full with a possible Austrian-Turkish alliance. </p>

<p>Maybe you can offer Russia Sweden in 1901 in exchange for building in the south (where he will need defenses against AT anyway). </p>

<p>Now, you’re left with a decision on your opening. </p>

<p>A creative approach in keeping with your diplomatic agreements and suggestions, might be the <strong>Skagerrak Sentry</strong>. (This opening is a situational variant of <strong>The Jutland Gambit</strong>.)</p>

<p>In Spring 1901, begin with the Blitzkrieg Opening, Danish Variant. </p>

<aside>
  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-the-blitzkrieg-opening-danish-variant">The Blitzkrieg Opening, Danish Variant</h4>

  <p>F Kie-Den<br>

<p>Proceed, in Fall, with the Jutland Gambit:</p>

<aside>
  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-the-jutland-gambit">The Jutland Gambit</h4>

  <p>F Den-SKA<br>
A Kie-Den<br>
A Ruh-Hol</p>

</aside>

<p>In this situation, I am proposing to refer to the Jutland Gambit as the <strong>Skagerrak Sentry</strong>. </p>

<p>In my understanding, the point of the Jutland Gambit is to delay the choice of a victim. However, in the current scenario, you as Germany have a pre-arranged alliance with France and planned attack on England. The point of the move F Den-SKA provides diplomatic and tactical influence to dissuade England of your intentions. </p>

<p>In this game, England self-bounces in London to keep it open for a build.</p>

<p>England will have to continue to play very well to remain in the game.</p>

<p>Even if England has begun to sniff out your intended antagonism, you as Germany are still in a very good position to work with France to pick apart England. </p>

<p>You will likely be building 2 as Germany: a fleet in Kiel and an army of your choosing. (Occasionally, with your second build you can construct a third fleet in Berlin.)</p>

<p>In this scenario, your ally France has picked up 2 builds.</p>

<p>From here, with or without French support from ENG, you can aim for a fleet in NTH by Spring or Fall 1902. </p>

<p>(Even if the English manage to hold NTH, your F SKA is an excellent positional diplomatic tool with both England and Russia.)</p>

<p>Once your German fleets command the North Sea, the wind is most certainly at your back!</p>

<p>Congratulations, you’ve succeeded in implementing the <strong>Skagerrak Sentry</strong>.</p>

<p>Just don’t be too proud of yourself until you wrap up the board top. </p>

<aside class="tip blurb">
    <p>Remember to advertise your move to SKA as beneficial to both England and Russia. England probably has a right to skepticism (you’ve allowed Russia into Sweden), but you can point out that you do now have two units bordering Sweden (to be used at the right time). Keep Turkey and Austria active as you will need Russia to be occupied long enough for you to carve England and prepare for your middle game. </p>

<p>Next up, we take a look at <strong>The Venetian Vanishing</strong>, a creative join-Austrian/Italian opening.</p>

  <p>You were lucky and drew <em>Austria</em> in the final game of a 3-game tournament.
How will you open? </p>

  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-consider-1">Consider</h4>
  <p>Italy is a creative player and likes trying new things. Russia and Turkey seem a little standoffish if not openly pleasant. This concerns you slightly, and you opt to make Italy an interesting offer, at least to shore up some chances of an ally.</p>

<p>You offer to have Italy blow up your fleet in Fall 1901–in Venice–in exchange for collaboration in the early game. </p>

<p>In Spring 1901, with Austria, open to Venice.</p>

<p>Diplomatically, Austria and Italy can play this in several ways. I’m sure you can imagine the questions you will be asked. And perhaps some of the responses you might give. As Italy: “We were planning a Tyrolian Lepanto but then he stabbed me!” </p>

<p>With only one unit bordering Greece (A Ser), there are possibilities diplomatically that are far-reaching.</p>

<p>One approach: As Italy, encourage Turkey to bounce Austria’s A Ser-Gre, in order to occupy the Bulgarian army. </p>

<p>Austria can then play Russia and Turkey off one another, depending on if Russia is in Gal or Rum, and what happened in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Proceed, in Fall, with the following:</p>

</div>


<p>Austria disbands the fleet and hopefully builds 2 armies.</p>

<p>While Italy doesn’t build, the position is stable to deflect the Turkish F Smy-AEG in Spring, before relinquishing it in Fall 1902 in order to take Tunis by convoy. Depending on the appetite of Austria/Italy, Italy can take Trieste for himself as part of the agreement in 1902. </p>

<p>By then, Austria’s <em>five</em> armies will have had a chance to wreak havoc in the Balkans.</p>


<h2 id="Exploration">Chapter 7: Exploration</h2>

<p>How do you teach a new player the basics and finer points of Diplomacy? Can it be done? Or is this a journey that must be taken by the new players themselves? </p>

<p>As for the rules, Mark Berch<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">25</a></sup> suggests handing new players the first chapter of Richard Sharp’s <em>The Game of Diplomacy</em>, entitled ‘Fundamentals’.<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">26</a></sup> </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-a-discussion-of-experience">A Discussion of Experience</h3>

<p>So much depends on what experience we want new players to have.</p>

<p>Each new player is different, so it can be good to consider sizing up a new player so as to provide for them the best new player offering. </p>

<p>But first, for context, let me share an email I sent the leadership council for the MN Diplomacy Club: </p>

<p>Here’s an email I wrote to our club council leadership about new players’ first few games:</p>

<p><em>start of email</em>  </p>

<p>One thing I’ve observed our group doing well is asking players how the game went, and listening. In the case of Jake P at David’s house, I remember commenting that he took his relatively early defeat (1904/5 I believe) quite well. He even asked me eventually what I thought he could have done better. In reply, I asked him what <em>he</em> thought he could have done better, to encourage him to develop his thinking on the game. He had a few ideas, so that was good.</p>

<p>Last night Owen made a comment about making a mistake as Germany and I did my best to reward him for noticing that he had much to learn. During the game, Jake did a pretty cool thing and interrupted a discussion between he and Owen to advise him on how not to shut the discussion down.</p>

<p>I didn’t ask you guys about this (from a GM influencing the game perspective), but when newer players looked hopeless and were alone at the board last night, I asked them questions like: How are you going to solve your problems? Main idea was to get them to stay engaged in the game and thinking through strategic offers they might make to survive, etc.</p>

<p>I liked Ben’s involving of all players post-game in a discussion about end-of-season awards. </p>

<p>Also, this game probably isn’t for everyone, although I agree we should try to hold interest if there is genuine interest and not crush souls mercilessly (some people just take losses badly, and could still make excellent Diplomacy players).</p>

<p>I do like the two-pronged approach of leveling up our new players and finding existing Diplomacy players in our Minnesota community. Last summer there was a Diplomacy game on my rooftop (which I was not involved in), so there are people underground doing mischevious things. If we can find them. A flyer or sign at our Fantasy Flight games will do nicely. </p>

<p>(One personal goal I have, and maybe you guys share it, is to become a better Diplomacy player…and having top competition helps, ideally 7 very good players every game. For example, if we are going to represent Minnesota well at tournaments, it may help to have the best training we can manage.)</p>

<p>By now you can probably guess my current position on an NPR: I prefer not to have it. </p>

<p>I am also partial against limiting new players to France and Turkey. A bad first game with Turkey is not only bad but probably boring…not a good combo. (I don’t happen to find Turkey boring, but a new player may not recognize this.) As for France…if you have a bad first game, at least you get to sail into the Mid-Atlantic with decent wine and fresh baguettes. </p>

<p>I get the relatively strong defensive positions of F and T, but if we’re looking for new players to survive and have more play, an additional choice might also be Italy. So much depends on the kind of experience we want them to have. </p>

<p>A different approach would be to take an extra 5-10 minutes before game start to suggest 2-3 strategic areas to focus their negotiations in 1901/2/3. </p>

<p><em>end of email</em></p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-what-is-most-important-to-teach">What is Most Important to Teach?</h3>

<p>You may be tempted to teach newcomers the game all at once. </p>

<p>That would be very hard.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to teach them just the basics. </p>

<p>But even if this is a good approach, what are ‘the basics’?</p>

<p>As we’ve seen, there are numerous dimensions to Diplomacy. Is negotiation skill more important than strategy? Is strategy more important than tactics? Is negotiation more important than tactics? Sometimes, usually, and not always (all at once). If negotiation is more important than tactics, how should one teach negotiation in a short pre-game session? If strategy is most important, which nuggests might be shared with the completely new player?</p>

<p>Jake Langenfeld, part of the MN Diplomacy leadership council, recently shared that the Windy City Weasels take new player integration very seriously. To do so, they have a Newbie Protection Rule. The advantage is new players get a longer (and hopefully better) game. The disadvantage was the metagame surrounding the rule, given that new players weren’t aware of it. </p>

<p>In a recent game of poker, I went all in against a new player’s river bet, and after consideration he incorrectly called. After the hand, I explained to him that I respected him too much not to go all in there. “I hate it when people go easy on me,” I said, and others around the table agreed. Most of us can tell when we’re being “helped” and for anyone with an ounce of competitiveness in their bodies, this approach risks feeling like an insult. </p>

<p>If a Newbie Protection Rule <em>isn’t</em> in play, how are we then to do our best to give newcomers a good first experience? </p>

<p>Again, my baseline on this is that I don’t like to <em>steal someone’s destiny</em>. If someone is going to crash and burn, that might be just fine. You actually don’t know if the experience will enliven them for a return to the arena. As in <em>Minority Report</em>, when in one of the opening scenes, the protagonist catches a ball falling from the table, he doesn’t really know if the ball would have hit the ground (because he caught it). </p>

<p>Another poker analogy serves well here: I’ve been asked by players who fold to my bluffs (or value bets) if, had they raised or gone all-in, if I would have called. My standard response to this is usually, “I don’t know, because you didn’t do it.” </p>

<p>The MN Diplomacy Club has experimented with allowing new players their choice of country, suggesting against the central powers and Russia. Recently, we made the decision to begin new player initiation with an overview of the rules and light strategy for 1901-1902 for each country, and then allow the new player/s to make their country selections first (any power they would like).</p>

<p>We will see how this goes and report back to the Diplomacy community.</p>

<p>In the future, we will as a community be able to consolidate, develop, and share guides and strategies (strategies of teaching) that better acclimate a new player to the game without ruining their first game, giving them a chance for a good experience, get them excited about the game, and also enliven their own spirit of exploration. As I hope has been apparent throughout this book, I am enthusiastic about exploring the unknown territories of Diplomacy and face to face Diplomacy more specifically. If this can be sparked in new players from their first game, all the better.</p>

<p>My favorite games are among 7 very solid Diplomacy players, but new players should be encouraged, because who knows what potential greats are still waiting to play their very first game. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-diplomacy-clubs">Diplomacy Clubs</h3>

<p>Do you run a Diplomacy club? </p>

<p>How do you initiate new players? </p>

<p>How do you ensure new players come back and play again? </p>

<p>How much of the rules do you share? Do you provide examples of supports and support cutting? What about braces, uncuttable supports? </p>

<p>Which elements of strategy do you discuss? Country specific dynamics? Logistics, pace, growth, targets? </p>

<p>What about game flow? Game theory? </p>

<p>Negotiation, psychology, tactics? </p>

<p>I’m very curious. </p>

<p>Please share any ideas you have with erik.vanmechelen@gmail.com</p>


<h2 id="leanpub-auto-begin-again-becoming-a-lifelong-diplomacy-player">Begin Again: Becoming a Lifelong Diplomacy Player</h2>

<p>As is taught in meditation practices around the world, the important thing is to notice, and then begin again. </p>

<p>With each new game within me rises hope, potential for heroism, and the sweet taste of victory. </p>

<p>This same hope rests in each player’s heart and mind, which makes for an interesting affair, to say the least!</p>

<p>This book is the beginning of my attempt to develop a <a href="#Philosophy">Philosophy</a> of Diplomacy, and, so equipped, build a roadmap for becoming a better Diplomacy player.</p>

<p>A grander vision, if I may, would be for such a roadmap to align with my efforts to become a better human. (In a game which seems to encourage lies and deceit, it very much remains to be seen if these goals are mutually compatible.) </p>

<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="#Overture">Overture</a>, this book is the beginning of a project which will continue. I hope to endeavor to elaborate more completely my experiences and potential insights, so as to be less wrong in the future. As a fallible being, that is my hope for us all. </p>

<h2 id="75Territories">Appendix: 75 Territories</h2>

<p>The Diplomacy map feels crowded. Because it is. </p>

<p>Of the 75 spaces, 34 are supply centers.</p>

<p>Many spaces aren’t used that often. Perhaps 50 territories are important (to varying degrees), with the remaining 24 used situationally.</p>

<p>What follows is merely (primarily?) for amusement.</p>

<p><em>‘SC’ to indicate supply center.</em></p>

<p><em>‘HSC’ to indicate home supply center.</em></p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-landlocked-or-coastal-provinces">Landlocked or Coastal Provinces</h3>

<p><strong>Bohemia: Boh</strong> </p>

<p>Alongside Tyrolia, this territory separates Austria and Germany. Borders Munich, Vienna, Silesia, and Galicia as well.</p>

<p><strong>Budapest: Bud (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Key Austria home center bordering two out of the four Balkan neutral supply centers (Serbia and Rumania).</p>

<p><strong>Galicia: Gal</strong></p>

<p>Usually an important point of discussion for the Archduke and Czar in 1901 as it borders two Austria home centers and Rumania.</p>

<p><strong>Trieste: Tri (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Austria’s only coastal home center.</p>

<p><strong>Tyrolia: Tyr</strong></p>

<p>Accessible in Spring 1901 by Austria, Germany, and most usefully by Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Vienna: Vie (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>As Austria, are you opening to Trieste, Galicia, or Budapest?</p>

<p><strong>Clyde: Cly</strong></p>

<p>Borders English home centers Edinburgh and Liverpool. Sparsely visited.</p>

<p><strong>Edinburgh: Edi (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Northern English home center bordering the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea.</p>

<p><strong>Liverpool: Lvp (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>English home center. Also England’s side door, often visited by France via F MAO-IRI.</p>

<p><strong>London: Lon (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Building Fleets here gives more flexibility than Edinburgh.</p>

<p><strong>Wales: Wal</strong></p>

<p>Useful for attacking and defending the island.</p>

<p><strong>Yorkshire: Yor</strong></p>

<p>Borders all three English home centers. Open A Lvp-Yor unless you are sure France won’t be in the English Channel.</p>

<p><strong>Brest: Bre (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>One of two French coastal home centers, bordering the critical Mid-Atlantic Ocean and English Channel.</p>

<p><strong>Burgundy: Bur</strong></p>

<p>Pivotal territory for French defense and access to Belgium, Ruhr, and Munich.</p>

<p><strong>Gascony: Gas</strong></p>

<p>Defensive territory bordering Brest, Paris, Marseilles, and Spain. Featured in the Iberian Indecision opening.</p>

<p><strong>Marseilles: Mar (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Fleet builds here are not necessarily pro-English.</p>

<p><strong>Paris: Par (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>French home center with good spacing.</p>

<p><strong>Picardy: Pic</strong></p>

<p>French armies show up here when the President wishes to guarantee influence on Belgium without irritating Germany in Burgundy. English armies may arrive here by convoy as well. </p>

<p><strong>Berlin: Ber (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>German home center available for both army and fleet builds.</p>

<p><strong>Kiel: Kie (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Important German home center bordering neutrals Denmark and Holland. Available for both army and fleet builds.</p>

<p><strong>Munich: Mun (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Arguably THE center. Germany’s most important home center. Access to 8 adjacent and active territories. Featured in Richard Sharp’s Anschluss theory.</p>

<p><strong>Prussia: Pru</strong></p>

<p>Just south of the Gulf of Bothnia, this territory sees utility in northern conflicts.</p>

<p><strong>Ruhr: Ruh</strong></p>

<p>Defensive and offensive territory for Germany, bordering Munich, Burgundy, Holland, and Belgium. </p>

<p><strong>Silesia: Sil</strong></p>

<p>Critical mid-game territory between Germany, Russia, and Austria. Stalemate importance.</p>

<p><strong>Apulia: Apu</strong></p>

<p>Borders Venice, Naples, and the Ionian. Common to see an army here defensively or for potential convoys (Tunis; Albania).</p>

<p><strong>Naples: Nap (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Italian home center and most reliable place for a Winter 1901 fleet build.</p>

<p><strong>Piedmont: Pie</strong></p>

<p>Land route between France and Italy. With Switzerland, it is key for stalemate lines.</p>

<p><strong>Rome: Rom (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Coastal home center. Building a fleet here has less flexibility than F Nap, but if you’re building two…</p>

<p><strong>Tuscany: Tus</strong></p>

<p>Borders Rome, Venice, and Piedmont.</p>

<p><strong>Venice: Ven (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Italian home center bordering Austria’s home center, Trieste.</p>

<p><strong>Livonia: Lvn</strong></p>

<p>With an army, borders StP, War, Pru, and Mos. Also see the Livonian Lunacy opening.</p>

<p><strong>Moscow: Mos (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Key Russian home center. In the early and mid-game it is useful for positioning and influence, but in the north and south.</p>

<p><strong>Sevastopol: Sev (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>If Russia can clear this home center, they might find use for a second southern fleet.</p>

<p><strong>St. Petersburg: StP (HSC) (north &amp; south coasts)</strong></p>

<p>For fleet builds and fleet movement, specify your coast!</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine: Ukr</strong></p>

<p>Useful defensive and setup territory for Russia.</p>

<p><strong>Warsaw: War (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Russian home center connected to Moscow and with access to Prussia, Silesia, Galicia, and Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong>Ankara: Ank (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>Turkish home center bordering the pivotal Black Sea.</p>

<p><strong>Armenia: Arm</strong></p>

<p>As Turkey, useful leverage against Sevastopol. </p>

<p><strong>Constantinople: Con (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>The Bosporus creates a defensive bottleneck, but until the sultan has a fleet in the Aegean or the Black Sea, it will be difficult to mobilize armies. May be traversed by armies and fleets.</p>

<p><strong>Smyrna: Smy (HSC)</strong></p>

<p>I hear Antalya is quite pleasant. The Italians have heard that too.</p>

<p><strong>Syria: Syr</strong></p>

<p>Where the Italians may opt to convoy if they can’t get into Smyrna. </p>

<p><strong>Albania: Alb</strong></p>

<p>Another potential convoy landing zone for Italy. </p>

<p><strong>Belgium: Bel (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Of interest to England, France, and Germany.</p>

<p><strong>Bulgaria: Bul (SC) (south and east coast)</strong></p>

<p>Turkey’s 100% in Spring 1901.</p>

<p><strong>Denmark: Den</strong></p>

<p>Neutral center often occupied by Germany. Similar to Constantinople, can be traversed by armies and fleets.</p>

<p><strong>Finland: Fin</strong></p>

<p>Comes into play in northern skirmishes.</p>

<p><strong>Greece: Gre (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Often Austria’s to begin with, but the Italian and Turk have their say as well.</p>

<p><strong>Holland: Hol (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Germany can guarantee Holland in 1901, and often claims it even if opening to Denmark.</p>

<p><strong>Norway: Nwy (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Usually scooped by England (with a fleet or army), and creates negotiation opportunities given its bordering Russia’s Saint Petersburg. (Russia can’t access it in 1901 given its fleet begins the game on Saint Petersburg’s south coast.)</p>

<p><strong>North Africa: Naf</strong></p>

<p>Can be important for the MAO/WES/SPA stalemate line.</p>

<p><strong>Portugal: Por (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Easily accessible neutral center for France.</p>

<p><strong>Rumania: Rum (SC)</strong></p>

<p>One of the four highly contested Balkan centers. Russia can guarantee it in 1901, but only with concessions positionally.</p>

<p><strong>Serbia: Ser (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Balkan center usually claimed by Austria.</p>

<p><strong>Spain: Spa (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Neutral center easily collected by France. For fleet movement, specify north and south coasts!</p>

<p><strong>Sweden: Swe (SC)</strong></p>

<p>A topic of discussion for Germany and Russia. </p>

<p><strong>Tunis: Tun (SC)</strong></p>

<p>Will Italy secure it with a fleet or army in 1901?</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-bodies-of-water">Bodies of Water</h3>

<p><strong>Adriatic Sea: ADR</strong></p>

<p>Austrian home center and only Austrian salt water access.</p>

<p><strong>Aegean Sea: AEG</strong></p>

<p>Influence on the Ionian, Greece, Bulgaria (south coast), Constantinople, Smyrna, and the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>

<p><strong>Baltic Sea: BAL</strong></p>

<p>Borders two German home centers as well as Denmark and Sweden.</p>

<p><strong>Barents Sea: BAR</strong></p>

<p>Can be used by the English to support themselves into Saint Petersburg.</p>

<p><strong>Black Sea: BLA</strong></p>

<p>Borders five supply centers.</p>

<p><strong>Eastern Mediterranean: EAS</strong></p>

<p>Featured in Edi Birsan’s Lepanto opening.</p>

<p><strong>English Channel: ENG</strong></p>

<p>If you are England, consider opening here, if for no other reason but to keep the French out.</p>

<p><strong>Gulf of Bothnia: BOT</strong></p>

<p>The way by sea into Saint Petersburg’s south coast.</p>

<p><strong>Gulf of Lyon: GOL</strong></p>

<p>Borders Marseilles, Spain (south coast), Piedmont, Tuscany, the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Western Mediterranean.</p>

<p><strong>Helgoland Bight: HEL</strong></p>

<p>Imagine if this space didn’t exist. Does England or Germany do better?</p>

<p><strong>Ionian Sea: ION</strong></p>

<p>Often controlled for some time by Italy, but the President, Archduke, and Sultan would sure love to own it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Irish Sea: IRI</strong></p>

<p>England’s side door.</p>

<p><strong>Mid-Atlantic Ocean: MAO</strong></p>

<p>Critical for France’s mobility, defense, and attack.</p>

<p><strong>North Atlantic Ocean: NAO</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes used to support movement into the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p><strong>North Sea: NTH</strong></p>

<p>Borders 6 supply centers. Whichever Great Power controls it increases his potential greatly.</p>

<p><strong>Norwegian Sea: NWG</strong></p>

<p>England may open here to give themselves the option to convoy an army to Norway in Fall 1901 with either NWG or NTH. </p>

<p><strong>Skagerrak: SKA</strong></p>

<p>A very useful space. For <strong>The Skagerrak Sentry</strong> opening, see <a href="#Strategy">Strategy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tyrrhenian Sea: TYS</strong></p>

<p>Access to two Italian centers.</p>

<p><strong>Western Mediterranean: WES</strong></p>

<p>Critical in French/Italian conflict and on end-game stalemate lines.</p>


<h2 id="FirstGame">Appendix: Your First Game</h2>

<p>Avoid these blunders, survive till 1903, and have a grand adventure in your first Diplomacy game!</p>

<p>Face to face Diplomacy is a game of fast-paced strategic negotiations with six other human players and opponents. </p>

<p>Make a plan, sell the plan, execute the plan. </p>

<p>Speak with everyone, especially in 1901 and 1902, if only to offer the assistance of information gathering and to maintain a cordial relationship. </p>

<p>Don’t make the first wrong move, and seek to make the first right one.</p>

<p><strong>Be Likable</strong></p>

<p>If you know how to make someone smile, do that. </p>

<p>If you can’t, at least do so yourself. </p>

<p>Avoid real (or fake) anger. If you can’t control your emotions, how can I trust you to submit solid and accurate orders under time pressure?</p>

<p>Akin to the saying in poker (a chip and a chair), so long as you have one supply center and one unit, whether fleet or army, you are still in the game. </p>

<p>Never give up! </p>

<p>No one likes an angry player, but the whiner is perhaps worse. If you must lose, be a good loser. I’ll remember how gracefully you lost and you’ll have a chance to work with me in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Demonstrate Competetence</strong></p>

<p>Seek to learn the game, if you have spare time. </p>

<p>Ask your opponents why their plans are set up the way they are. </p>

<p>Make a plan. Strategically share your upcoming orders with allies (or opponents), and then make those moves. Build a competent and trust-worthy approach. Allies and adversaries, if they respect you, will play a certain way with and against you. </p>

<p><strong>Stay Active</strong></p>

<p>Diplomacy is a game of rotating allegiances and fortunes. Often, an early leader will threaten to build momentum, and other fights on the board are temporarily paused to ensure the early leader doesn’t get too big, too fast. </p>

<p>In situations like these, where the board position is uncertain, your rather feeble position of say three or four supply centers could finally find avenues for expansion.</p>

<p>The more plans, offers, and deals you make, the better your chances of success.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-if-you-are-playing-as">If you are playing as…</h4>

<p><strong>England</strong>  </p>

<p>Don’t lose the English Channel, or the North Sea. Find an ally in France or Germany. Don’t get too excited about a visit to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p><strong>France</strong></p>

<p>Don’t let Germany walk into Burgundy.</p>

<p><strong>Germany</strong>  </p>

<p>Avoid an early fight with Russia. If you capture the North Sea, you may well win. </p>

<p><strong>Italy</strong>  </p>

<p>Be patient. When the French bake baguettes, counter with ciabatta, and don’t take it out of the oven too soon! </p>

<p><strong>Austria</strong>  </p>

<p>The Hedgehog (F Tri-Ven; A Vie-Gal; A Bud-Ser) will ensure you survive beyond 1902.</p>

<p><strong>Russia</strong></p>

<p>A northern campaign in the opening (A Mos-StP) is a luxury only to be committed to if Austria or Turkey is a strong ally. </p>

<p><strong>Turkey</strong></p>

<p>Patience. Turkey may seem boring and methodical. You’d be right to think that. If you capture the Black Sea, you’ll be hard to eliminate.</p>


<h2 id="Terminology">Appendix: Terminology</h2>

<p><strong>Dot/s</strong>: Supply Centers. Less of a mouthful.</p>

<p><strong>Tap</strong>: Move to. </p>

<p><strong>Do</strong>: Attack. As in: ‘Do Austria’.</p>

<p><strong>Poke</strong>: Needlessly attack. Usually deployed to discourage attacks upon oneself, as in: ‘You don’t need to poke me.’</p>

<p><strong>Stalemate Line</strong>: A position which is tactically unbreakable.</p>
