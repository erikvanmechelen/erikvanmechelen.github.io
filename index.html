<h1>No more rigged elections in Minnesota</h1>
<small>Let's start by understanding 2020</small>
</header>

<p>
	We the People have lost confidence in our elections process. We don't trust the machines which slice and dice our votes; we don't like insecure mass mail-in absentee ballots; we don't appreciate internet-connected poll books linked to the statewide voter registration system in the cloud.

</p><p>
	Is it not the case that this broken process not only (s)elects the leader of the free world but also those who run our children's schools?
</p><p>
	Yes, the 2020 election was rigged in Minnesota. But it has been for quite some time. We could shrug our shoulders and say, What can we really do? Or we can put the truth on the table, brick by brick.
</p><p>
	What happened should never be allowed to happen again. As Minnesota's next Secretary of State, I will make sure of that.
</p><p>
	Going forward, your voice and vote will count.
</p><p>
	This past year, I've worked with and learned from local and national grassroots leaders including some of the very best in the fields of cyber security, networks, and information warfare, to be well equipped for the road ahead. This <a href="https://leanpub.com/mn2020/" target=_new>book</a> details that journey.
	</p><p>
	That being said, the failed and corrupt political establishment's time is up. It would be an honor to serve you in public office.
<strong>
	Please join me in reclaiming the government for we the people.

Here is a short book describing what I've learned.
