<h1>No more rigged elections in Minnesota</h1>
<small>Toward Free, Fair, and 100% Auditable Elections</small>
</header>

<p>
	We the People have lost confidence in our elections process. We don't trust the machines which slice and dice our votes; we don't like insecure mass mail-in absentee ballots; we have lost faith in internet-connected poll books linked to the statewide voter registration system in the cloud which knows when you check in to vote on election day (and who doesn't).

</p><p>
	Is it not the case that this broken process not only (s)elects the leader of the free world but also those who run our children's schools? The software underpinning Dominion, ES&S, and Hart is Smartmatic (Sequoia), which has not only determined elections in the United States but very likely abroad.
</p><p>
	Yes, the 2020 election was also rigged in Minnesota. But (s)elections have been taking place for quite some time. Sadly we may never know what happened in 2018 because under <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&num=0&edition=prelim" target=_new>USC 52 Chapter 207 §20701</a> physical and digital election records need only be maintained for 22 months. However in 2020, despite a massive coverup attempt and aggressive censorship, we are learning the details of the coup. For example, <a href="<a href=https://mega.nz/file/OxFSjKTR#BysgZkjnmXQwFl2bqo2_0ufAvQOQ7IwOzFxiItavfzg target=_new>" target=_new>an analysis of the Mesa County</a>, Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS) server from the 2020 and 2021 elections <a href="<a href=https://mega.nz/file/OxFSjKTR#BysgZkjnmXQwFl2bqo2_0ufAvQOQ7IwOzFxiItavfzg target=_new>" target=_new>proved database manipulation</a> that initially went undetected by the office of the county clerk and recorder, Tina Peters. Only her courageous decision to save images of the server before and after the Dominion "Trusted Build" in Spring 2021 preserved the opportunity for data analysts to investigate. This work made it possible for the rest of us to learn information I imagine Dominion never wanted you to know. Is Minnesota also paying this vendor for its services?

</p><p>
	And yet, with clear wrongdoing, where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, 'What can we really do?' We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could give up.
</p><p>
	Or we can put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of wilful ignorance.
</p><p>
	In other states like Nevada, county commissioners are already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE" target=_new> making decisions</a> to remove electronic voting equipment from upcoming elections and making plans to return to counterfeit-proof paper ballots hand-counted on a single election day. Minnesotans have attended their county commissioner meetings speaking toward those same ends—that trend is likely to continue. Counties that move to a machine-free alternative will gain confidence in the election process and results and set a positive example for counties that follow. Meanwhile, our legislators can at any time draft common sense election legislation like Arizona. Or maybe a lawsuit similar to the one filed in Arizona on April 22, 2022—which seeks to ban ballot-counting machines—could succeed in Minnesota.
</p><p>
	What happened in 2020 (and in the preceding decades) should never be allowed to happen again. As Minnesota's next Secretary of State, I will make sure of that.
</p><p>
	<strong>Going forward, your voice and vote will count, perhaps for the first time in your life.</strong>
</p><p>
	This past year, I've worked with and learned from local and national grassroots leaders including some of the very best in the fields of cyber security, networks, law, and information warfare, to be well equipped for the road ahead. This <a href="https://leanpub.com/mn2020/" target=_new>book</a> details that ongoing journey.
	</p><p>
	This all being said, the failed and corrupt political establishment's time is up. It would be an honor to serve you in public office alongside many other grassroots leaders who have alrady stood up and stepped onto a path to truly get results in Minnesota.
</p><p>
	Among the Minnesota Secretary of State's responsibilities are chairing the State Canvassing Board, convening Minnesota's electoral college, and serving on the Executive Council and Board of Investment. But perhaps the most important responsibility is the administration of Minnesota election law, including strict adherence to critical statutes such as <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57" target=_new>206.57 EXAMINATION OF NEW VOTING SYSTEMS</a> and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.121" target=_new>203B121 BALLOT BOARDS</a>. I will make effective partnerships with county auditors and city and township officials to carry out free, fair, and auditable elections. If any county commissioners send me <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/motion-passed-to-request-minnesota" target=_new>a resolution in favor of an audit in their county</a>, as happened in Crow Wing County in January 2022, I will do the right thing. If counties <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.58" target=_new>opt out of electronic voting machines</a> (poll books, tabulators, and election management systems), I will connect them with experts capable of setting up counterfeit-proof paper ballots which can be hand-counted in small precincts on election day. I will take advice from local experts on major amendments to the statewide voter registration system and make it transparently available to the public to reduce or eliminate ready-to-launch voters.
</p><p>
	What's perhaps more important is that you stay as informed as you can while continuing to ask questions. The powers that be don't like when we submit FOIA or public data requests, show up at county commissioner meetings to share evidence, or otherwise use our first amendment rights, but if we don't hold those in public office accountable, who will? We are the people we've been waiting for.
<strong>
	Please join me in reclaiming the government for We the People.
</strong>
</p><p>
	If you do decide to vote for me and we are still relying on electronic voting machines for the Primary (August 9th) and the General Election (November 8th), please cast your vote in-person at your precinct on election day. If enough of you do this, there could be a chance to overwhelm the algorithms.

	<small>How I Got Here and What I Learned So Far</small>
	<br>
Here is a short ongoing <a href="https://leanpub.com/mn2020/" target=_new>book</a> describing what I've learned about the (s)election process, with stories from Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium in South Dakota to county commissioners meetings in Dakota and Sherburne County to conversations with helpful men and women across the country who like me believe we can and must fix our broken system so that everyone no matter who or what you are voting for has confidence that their vote not only counted but wasn't cancelled by machine manipulation or illegal votes.
