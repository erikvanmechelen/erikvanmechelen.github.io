<h1>No more rigged elections in Minnesota</h1>
<h2>Toward Free, Fair, and 100% Auditable Elections</h2>

<p>
	In the early 1900s it took Bertrand Russell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica" target=_new>over 300 pages</a> to prove that 1 + 1 = 2. Thankfully with the work being done around the country since before November 3rd, 2020, it will not take nearly as long to unpack the state of our rigged election system and how to fix it.
</p><p>
	We the People have lost confidence in our elections process. Already in 2016 and earlier many were questioning election results, a sentiment which has intensified. We don't trust the machines which slice and dice our votes nor backdoors into election management systems; we don't like insecure mass mail-in absentee ballots and drop boxes exploited by vote trafficking organizations; we have lost faith in internet-connected poll books and inflated voter rolls obscured from public view.

</p><p>
	Is it not the case that this broken process not only (s)elects the leader of the free world, but also those who run our children's schools?
</p><p>
	The software underpinning Dominion, ES&S, and Hart is Smartmatic (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Voting_Systems" target=_new>Sequoia</a>), which has not only determined elections in the United States, but also as far afield as Venezuala in 2004.
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, ballot harvesting and ballot stuffing (as seen in documentaries like 2000 Mules) are alarming because they demonstrate physical ballot trafficking and raise additional questions: Who printed these ballots? With which templates? How were they provided to the mules? How did cover their digital tracks? In Minnesota, <a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/47803963-5178-4387-9865-0ea08f5332bd/downloads/22%2003%2017%20grewing%20complaint%20with%20exhibits.pdf?ver=1648648812808" target=_new>consent decrees</a> removed witness and signature requirements on absentee ballots.
</p><p>
	However, digital ballot trafficking remains a critical issue: after your ballot is scanned in to Dominion, ES&S, or Hart tabulators your voice through your vote can be changed in the backend of the servers storing those data points. Yes, ballot harvesting and ballot stuffing can cancel a real person's vote, but the machines can do so at scale in the 'black box' not even accessible to most election officials in charge of running elections in their counties.
</p><p>
	Electronic poll books connected to the internet provide access the statewide voter registration system in the cloud. Ask yourself, what benefit might that have from the perspective of monitoring or even controlling an election outcome? The current Minnesota Attorney General's <a href="https://twitter.com/keithellison/status/1323746158557253632" target=_new>tweet</a> at 3:57pm on election day suggests he had some knowledge of votes being cast in real time.
</p><p>
	It appears the 2020 election was also rigged in Minnesota. But (s)elections have been taking place for quite some time, probably since electronic equipment was introduced in the early 2000s (prior to that, old school methods were used). Sadly we may never know what happened in 2018 (and before) because under <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title52-section20701&num=0&edition=prelim" target=_new>USC 52 Chapter 207 §20701</a> physical and digital election records need only be maintained for 22 months. However in 2020, despite a massive coverup attempt and aggressive censorship, we are learning the details of the coup. For example, an analysis of the Mesa County, Colorado Dominion Voting Systems (DVS) Election Management System (EMS) server from the 2020 and 2021 elections <a href="https://magaraccoon.com/docs/MesaCountyReport3.pdf" target=_new> proved database manipulation</a> that initially went undetected by the office of the county clerk and recorder, Tina Peters. Only her courageous decision to save images of the server before and after the Dominion "Trusted Build" in Spring 2021 preserved the opportunity for data analysts to investigate. This work made it possible for the rest of us to learn information I imagine Dominion never wanted us to know. J. Alex Halderman's <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/sos/30lawens/Antrim.pdf" target=_new> report from Antrim</a>, County Michigan is also instructive on Dominion.
</p><p>
	What about Minnesota? In conversations I've observed or had with election officials, so far none have lost faith in the electronic voting equipment. But supposing you wanted to verify the output of the machine process with the results reported by precints, counties, or the secretary of state's website—how could you do that? One way would be to examine the cast vote record (CVR) reports, which are automatically generated by the tabulators as ballots are scanned in. However, to date, no CVRs have been shared with any Minnesotan requesting them, although one county attorney has said in writing that they do not have them, which either shows a lack of understanding of how the machines work, a lack of understanding of election record retention laws, or potentially an understanding that if shared the CVR provides the public a way to check the accuracy of reported election results.
</p><p>
	With a lack of transparency and demonstrated gaps in the election process across the country and in Minnesota, where are the consequences? We could shrug our shoulders and say, 'What can we really do?' We could sit back and see if the situation improves on its own. We could even give up.
</p><p>
	Or we can decide to put the truth on the table, brick by brick, so that before long every Minnesotan knows the truth—all except those that choose the temporary comforts of willful ignorance. Once enough people see what's wrong, available remedies will be welcomed.
</p><p>
	In other states like Nevada, county commissioners are already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBKz1o_VqAE" target=_new> making decisions</a> to remove electronic voting equipment from upcoming elections and making plans to return to counterfeit-proof paper ballots hand-counted in precinct on a single election day. Minnesotans have attended their county commissioner meetings and <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/open-forum-speakers-address-removing" target=_new>have spoken</a> toward those same ends—that trend is likely to continue.
</p><p>
	Counties that move to a machine-free alternative will gain confidence in the election process and results and set a positive example for counties that follow. Meanwhile, our legislators can at any time draft election legislation to remove electronic voting equipment. Or maybe a lawsuit similar to the one filed in Arizona on April 22, 2022—which seeks to ban ballot-counting machines—could succeed in Minnesota.
</p><p>
	What happened in 2020 (and in the preceding decades) should never be allowed to happen again. As Minnesota's next secretary of state, I will make sure of that.
</p><p>
	<strong>Going forward, your voice and vote will count, perhaps for the first time in your life.</strong>
</p><p>
	This past year, I've worked with and learned from local and national grassroots leaders including some of the very best in the fields of cyber security, networks, law, and information warfare, to be well equipped for the road ahead. (This free-to-read <a href="https://leanpub.com/mn2020/" target=_new>book</a> details that ongoing journey.)
	</p><p>
	This all being said, the failed and corrupt political establishment's time is up. It would be an honor to serve you in public office alongside many other grassroots servant leaders who have already stood up and stepped onto a path to truly get results in Minnesota.
</p><p>
	Among the Minnesota secretary of state's responsibilities are chairing the State Canvassing Board, convening Minnesota's electoral college, and serving on the Executive Council and Board of Investment. But perhaps the most important responsibility is the administration of Minnesota election law, including strict adherence to critical statutes such as <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.57" target=_new>206.57 EXAMINATION OF NEW VOTING SYSTEMS</a> and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/203B.121" target=_new>203B.121 BALLOT BOARDS</a> and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/204B.44" target=_new>204B.44 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS; REMEDY</a>.
</p><p>
	I will get to know county auditors and city and township officials to carry out free, fair, and auditable elections. If any county commissioners send me <a href="https://erikvanmechelen.substack.com/p/motion-passed-to-request-minnesota" target=_new>a resolution in favor of an audit in their county</a>, as happened in Crow Wing County in January 2022, I will do the right thing. If counties <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/206.58" target=_new>opt out of electronic voting machines</a> (e-poll books, tabulators, and election management systems), I will connect them to experts capable of setting up counterfeit-proof paper ballots which can be hand-counted in precinct on election day and immediately audited by anyone casting a vote. I will take advice from local experts on major amendments to the statewide voter registration system and make it transparently available to the public to reduce or eliminate ready-to-launch voters.
</p><p>
	What can you do? Perhaps most important is that you stay as informed as you can while continuing to ask questions. The powers that be don't like when we <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gb7dgx2v9t5du25/ES%26S_FOIA_Request_CVR.pdf?dl=0" target=_new>submit FOIA or public data requests</a>, show up at county commissioner meetings to share evidence, or otherwise use our first amendment rights, but if we don't hold those in public office accountable, who will? We are the people we've been waiting for.
<strong>
	Please join me in reclaiming the government for We the People.
</strong>
</p><p>
	If you do decide to vote for me and we are still relying on electronic voting machines for the Primary (August 9th) and the General Election (November 8th), please cast your vote in-person at your precinct on election day. If enough of you do this, there could be a chance to overwhelm the algorithms.
	</p><p>
	If possible I would have run for office with no party affiliation. The secretary of state's responsibilities should obviously be non-partisan. However, since it is not possible when running for secretary of state in Minnesota to have no party affiliation, I will run as a republican.
	</p>

	<strong><small>How I Got Here and What I Learned So Far</small></strong>
	<p>
Here is a short ongoing <a href="https://leanpub.com/mn2020/" target=_new>book</a> (read for $0) describing what I've learned about the (s)election process, with stories from Mike Lindell's Cyber Symposium in South Dakota to county commissioners meetings in Dakota and Sherburne County to conversations with helpful men and women across the country who like me believe we can and must fix our broken system so that everyone no matter who or what you are voting for has confidence that their vote not only counted but wasn't cancelled by machine manipulation or illegal votes. (You can opt in to email updates which sends you a new version every time content is added.)
</p>
<strong><small>No Donations</small></strong>
	<p>I will <strong>not</strong> be accepting donations. This is a grassroots movement where everyone can do their part by saying and doing the right thing to preserve election integrity for all Minnesotans. We do not know how long or hard the struggle will be, but our combined voices and actions, God willing, may lead to lasting change.
