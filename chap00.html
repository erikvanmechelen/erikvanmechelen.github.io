<p>For the last 15 years I have wondered what draws me to Diplomacy. Why do I love it? What gets me excited to play? How does the game produce in me an amazing state of flow? What is so interesting about post-game analysis with fellow players?</p>

<p>While I missed out on postal play, I did read with great interest the recaps of brilliantly written diplomacy correspondence. My gravitation toward creative writing wrapped up in a negotiation-based strategy game. If only I’d been born a few decades sooner.</p>

<p>Instead I got my start in face to face Diplomacy, then in a club I founded, and gained yet more experience over the DPJudge.</p>

<p>The gaming marketplace offers many good and even great games. And yet playing face to face Diplomacy is hard to match.</p>

<p>Why? How does Diplomacy, played over the board against six other humans, set itself apart?</p>

<p>Maybe it is because of how closely Diplomacy mirrors important elements in our lives. We live in a world where cooperation towards goals is useful yet requiring negotiation and value creation. But even among the best minds and with the best available technology, this collaboration doesn’t seem to be open-ended, at least not in the time-boundedness of our short lives, and at least in the context of material resources or things. (In a mutual, careful, and unbiased pursuit of truth in a striving for better outcomes, I believe we <em>can</em> be aligned in an open-ended way…alas this won’t be the subject of this book.)</p>

<p>Similarly, Diplomacy is constrained, time-bound, and rife with limitation. If thought of as a story, it is character-driven. Whether Sultan or Czar, each player struggles uphill. And although influenced by and influencing others, the player is essentially alone.</p>

<p>When I paused to reflect on the game, I realized something:</p>

<p>Unlike many other games…</p>

<p>The game of Diplomacy asks me as a player to have <a href="chap03.html#Philosophy">a philosophy</a> of Diplomacy. This goes way beyond how I value solos, draws, and survival, or how I approach playing each great power, or even how I negotiate with collaborators and competitors.</p>

<p>Indeed, beginning to ask this question moved me from ‘How do I get better at Diplomacy?’ to ‘How do I become a better Diplomacy player?’ </p>

<p>The difference is subtle, but crucial.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re entering this book hoping to become better at Diplomacy. I know how that goes. (Allow me a short anecdote.)</p>

<p>I remember drawing England in one of my first games. My fascination is immediate: England is great! Fleets are amazing! I might have soloed if France doesn’t stab me in 1904. Then I get a turn as Germany, and think: England is nice, but Germany is way more fun–I get to influence <em>everything</em>. A few months go by and I’ve applied some opening theory I read on diplomacy-archive.net. <em>Oh wait</em>, I realize, Italy is actually halfway decent…if only I have the patience and the skill to control the speed of the game.</p>

<p>Maybe you see what is missing there.</p>

<p>Before I make the reveal, and to provide an additional example by analogy, let’s look at a similar journey I took in college: my attempt to get better at poker. </p>

<p>With a background in live poker in high school, I tried my hand online. I learned the fundamentals and started winning at low stakes. Time to move up, but when I struggled at mid-stakes, instead of figuring out why, I try heads-up instead. Ahhh, there’s so much freedom in heads-up, and my bluffs actually work! Again, I have mild success at small stakes, but meet headwinds at mid-stakes. Books, articles, and hand histories showcase my technical and tactical leaks. Next I get a “heads-up-display” to monitor live stats (so I can play more tables profitably) and play 6-8 full ring tables at a time. I’m doing okay, but the urge to play heads-up returns. Decent win-rates at low-stakes gives me confidence to approach and actually have moderate success at mid-stakes. Time for high-stakes, right? Well, worth a try. My results suggest something is sorely missing.</p>

<p>You may have guessed: I didn’t have a philosophy of poker. I didn’t have a good model of what poker was, nor how I wanted to play within that landscape of possibilities. Dan Harrington, one of less than a handful of people to make back-to-back final tables at the WSOP, explains that poker is a game of wagering.<sup id="fnref-Foo1"><a href="chap14.html#fn-Foo1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This may not strike you as anything close to a philosophy of poker, but it was better than my vague ideas about poker at the time.</p>

<p>Part of what I’m doing in this book is encouraging myself (and you) to formulate and develop a philosophy of Diplomacy. (For what it’s worth, doing this exercise seems to help in other areas of life, too.) Once I have the beginnings of a philosophy, I can walk more confidently on the path to being a better Diplomacy player. Perhaps you’ll join me in this adventure.</p>

<p>If asking oneself “What is my philosophy of Diplomacy?” doesn’t, after a few measures of silence, produce within you a response, give the following a good try instead: </p>

<aside class="exercise_blurb blurb">
    <h4 id="leanpub-auto-ask-yourself">Ask yourself:</h4>

  <p>What sort of game is Diplomacy, really?  </p>

  <p>Given that, what combination of attributes, skills, and mentality would I expect are required to be successful as a player in that game? (Particularly in face to face Diplomacy.)  </p>

  <p>Too hard? Try these slightly easier ones:  </p>

  <p>What are my lifetime goals within the hobby? (What is Diplomacy to you? An interest, a hobby, a passion, a calling?)  </p>

  <p>What characteristics do I respect in an opponent?  </p>

  <p>If I hold grudges against a certain opponent, for what reasons do I hold them?  </p>

  <p>What reputation would I ideally have as a Diplomacy player?  </p>

</aside>

<p>Answering these questions suggests underlying beliefs and values, and hint at the model which you have constructed for what Diplomacy is and represents for you.</p>

<p>My responses to these questions are provided in the Chapter on <a href="chap03.html#Philosophy">Philosophy</a>.<sup id="fnref-Foo2"><a href="chap14.html#fn-Foo2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>  </p>

<p>You might read this and think, as my wife does, that all this is a bit dramatic. After all, Diplomacy is a just a game. </p>

<p>But some things are more than just games. </p>

<p>I doubt the Diplomacy hobby and community persists because there is “just a game” there. There is something about the preparation for, the experience of, and aftermath of a good game (or tournament) of Diplomacy that enlivens all of our spirits. Especially when played face to face.</p>

<p>It is with this–ahem–spirit, that I come to write this book.</p>

<p>I know all too well I am not alone in many of these sentiments. We have the tremendous privilege to play Diplomacy. It may well also be our responsibility to enjoy it, as well as to strive to uncover what secrets it may yet hold for us.</p>

<p>Whether you are with or against me, let’s press on (into the English Channel).</p>

<p>Shall we?</p>

<p>Please be aware: this book will have mistakes. Those are mine. I wrote the bulk of this book at a fever pitch across a few short days in between other projects (I write for a living). If there are good ideas within these pages, they are very likely other people’s. To me, that I might draw from other’s experience and knowledge is the benefit of a good culture, and the Diplomacy hobby seems to have a good one.</p>

<p>My sincere wish is to join the chorus of voices already carrying on the discussion about Diplomacy, whether for sheer joy, to move the hobby forward, or to enhance the overall standard of play. </p>

<p>With luck this won’t be the last book I or anyone else writes about the game.</p>

<p>May we all mistrust any certainties we have about Diplomacy. In this way our mutual exploration might continue yet another 65 years hence from its humble origins 65 years ago.</p>
