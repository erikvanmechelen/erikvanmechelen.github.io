<h2 id="Inequality">Chapter 2: Inequality</h2>

<p>What does an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent being lack?  </p>

<p>Such a being lacks <em>limitation</em>.  </p>

<p>Limitation is perhaps the underlying factor that makes life beautiful.  </p>

<p>As humans, hand in hand with our limitation and fallibility we gain freedom and creativity. Perhaps also the need for work and sacrifice.  </p>

<p>In games, too, constraints hold within themselves the seeds of creativity.  </p>

<p>Inequality is a result of distributed limitations, and inequality is sown into the very fabric of Diplomacy. This design, I’m going to argue, is essential to what makes Diplomacy so captivating.  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-why-the-game-does-not-end-after-1901">Why the Game Does Not End After 1901</h3>

<p>Let’s imagine for a moment…</p>

<p>Each Great Power collects their neutral supply centers.</p>

<p>And promptly calls it a day. </p>

<p>After all, shouldn’t they be happy? They’ve all gained something. The Frenchman and German could settle into an armchair somewhere in the Low Countries and admire the elegance of the English fleets over a glass of champagne. The English sailors may well wave back. </p>

<p>But…no.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t happen, would it? </p>

<p>Here, the game of Diplomacy continues. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Despite our occasional sloth and laziness, it is not in our human nature to rest indefinitely. We want progress. We need to do better, get better, and get <em>more</em>. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-the-map-and-the-territory">The Map (and the Territory)</h3>

<p>One of my favorite game designers, Will Wright, famously referenced <em>A Pattern Language</em><sup id="fnref-foo12"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> in preparing the code for Simcity 2000. </p>

<p>Mr. Calhamer, in preparing The Game of Diplomacy, sought to mimic the historical position of the seven great powers in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The design architecture is true to historical and geographic realities, creating a lovely imbalance.  </p>

<p>Not unlike a dynamic chess mid-game, or a delicate local-global position in Go.  </p>

<p>Here though is one of the game’s major advantages: Diplomacy players need not wait for the mid-game to pique their interest, as Diplomacy’s opening positions suggest the flaws inherent in human nature and showcase the potential of unique combinations of strengths. </p>

<p>Each power’s offensive and defensive prospects, territorial influence, and overall tecture inflect their player’s diplomatic starting point. But as in the game of life, what a player does with his shake of fate’s die is up to him. How you will you move what <em>is</em> toward what <em>should be</em>?</p>

<p>Given the unequal starting positions, what <em>should be</em> your objective? More on this in <a href="chap08.html#Strategy">Strategy</a>.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-spatial-relationships">Spatial Relationships</h4>

<p>When I first discovered Douglas Crockford’s Diplomacy map, it changed the way I looked at the game. Simply put, Mr. Crockford’s map gives less attention to the geographical shape of Europe and more attention to the relevant spacial relationships in the game itself.</p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">

  </figure>
</div>


<p>When I asked for permission to reference his map, Mr. Crockford quipped: “Do what you like. I think the map had a bigger impact on you than on the world.”</p>

<p>Perhaps we can change that. </p>

<aside>
  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-what-might-we-learn">What Might We Learn?</h4>

  <p>Notice how spatial relationships seem to differ between a standard Diplomacy map and the Crockford version.</p>

  <p>Which territories seem to gain in significance? Which are diminished? </p>

</aside>

<p>I’m not suggesting that the Diplomacy map presents a visual illusion. But perhaps it <em>disguises</em> otherwise easily understood relationships. For instance, it requires the same number of moves (2) to bring an army from Paris to Spain as it does from Armenia to Moscow. Likewise, a fleet going from Belgium to Kiel requires the same number of moves (2) as a fleet going from Tunis to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>After seeing how the pieces move, it is clear that a great distance might be traveled in only 2 or 3 moves. However, because of unit density (and not to mention strategic and diplomatic requirements), those 2 or 3 moves may take much longer than 2 or 3 seasons to enact. Furthermore–and this is another aspect of unit density and the rule of one-unit-per-territory–it often requires <em>several</em> units in coordination (through supports, support-cutting, or convoying) to successfully move a unit to a new territory. </p>

<p>As I gained experience in the game, it was interesting to learn where the board tended to be heavier or lighter, to understand which spaces held strategic importance, and how various territory’s significance <em>could</em> shift as alliances crumbled or new targets were taken on.</p>

<p>Having designed a couple or three of my own board games (as yet unpublished), I can only imagine the play-testing required to arrive at the current texture, shape, and harmony of the board. The dynamics it creates are wonderful to behold, and even better to experience. The opening phrases of Spring 1901 are but the first signs of melodies which develop into a great symphony; the waves of music unfurl as each iteration of the game plays out.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-fleets-and-armies">Fleets and Armies</h4>

<p>In my first game of Diplomacy, I drew England and came to know the power and versatility of fleets.</p>

<p>And then I played my first game as Austria, and understood armies better.</p>

<p>Then came Germany, and the tradeoffs between the two were even better understood.</p>

<p>Fleets and armies do not represent equal strengths. Sometimes a fleet is stronger. Sometimes an army. As will be discussed in <a href="chap08.html#Strategy">Strategy</a>, your units overall cohesion–how they work <em>together</em>–matters greatly. The strength of a unit usually relates also to the specific territory it occupies, as well as those territories adjacent to it. As in Go, where a stone placed adjacent another stone removes a liberty, it also removes a liberty of its own. Two adjacent units may provide support or cut support.</p>

<p>On the topic supports: a fleet’s support may not be cut by an army. But an army’s support may be cut by a fleet. In conjunction with a convoy order, armies can move a good distance and, even if they bounce in their destination, may still cut a support there.</p>

<p>Convoys, of course, are a luxury provided by fleets. And, in certain tactical situations, are safer plays than standard attacks. Consider the following convoy to Norway.</p>

<p>A tremendously overlooked strategic aspect (at least by newer players) is influencing where your opponents may build diplomatically <em>and</em> tactically. For example, if France has opened F Bre-ENG, he may sometimes get England to cover London (with A Yor-Lon or F NTH-Lon) and prevent a build of Fleet London in Winter 1901 adjustments. (So long as France doesn’t meddle too much with the English player’s head, France can justifiably argue that the Englishman has done this to himself.)</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-players-are-unequal">Players are Unequal</h3>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-experience-personality-and-standard-of-play">Experience, Personality, and Standard of Play</h4>

<p>Have you played as Germany before? What’s your experience in an English-French alliance? Have you successfully navigated the Balkans as Italy? </p>

<p>Are you playing with novices? Former World Champions? Are you playing with someone capable of misordering? What about a World Champion capable of writing a misorder (intentional or not)?</p>

<p>Your opponents will vary in general Diplomacy knowledge in the areas of dynamics, logistics, strategy, tactics, and negotiation. </p>

<p>Each will potentially have relationships with other players. Perhaps there are soft or strong allegiances to clubs or friends. Maybe players have history against one another.</p>

<p>This is more a discussion for <a href="chap08.html#Strategy">Strategy</a>, but it will not hurt to study a player’s historical record. At minimum, a complement on an opponent’s past record will create avenues toward trust and perhaps establish evidence of your competence (even though it merely suggests your ability to perform basic research).</p>

<p>Maybe your opponent has a reputation. Heaven forbid, maybe <em>you</em> do. How strongly do you perceive your opponents to be accounting for this in today’s game?</p>

<p>Finally (but this is far from exhaustive), each player arrives to the game with differing philosophies, personalities, and expectations. </p>

<p>Remember, over the course of enough games, each Diplomacy player will get to play each power a reasonable number of times. This may take awhile (Matthias, a member of the MN Diplomacy club, is still yet to play a Western power across 16 games). As in poker, where eventually you will be dealt a relatively even distribution of hands relative to your opponents, you will <em>eventually</em> get to play as each great power. </p>

<p>Given this knowledge, across a set of games, your goal might be to do better than most other players across each country. It seems likely that this conclusion led Diplomacy Clubs and tournament organizers to offer Best Country awards, recognizing the inequalities and also the reality that a given player will not get a chance to play all countries in a short space of time (whether a series of club games or a tournament). </p>

<p>How you use your read on players’ varying skill, experience, and style of play, will prove handy in devising your <a href="chap08.html#Strategy">Strategy</a> and approach to <a href="chap07.html#Negotiation">Negotiation</a>.</p>
