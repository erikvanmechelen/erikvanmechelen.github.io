<h2 id="Exploration">Chapter 7: Exploration</h2>

<p>How do you teach a new player the basics and finer points of Diplomacy? Can it be done? Or is this a journey that must be taken by the new players themselves? </p>

<p>As for the rules, Mark Berch<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">25</a></sup> suggests handing new players the first chapter of Richard Sharp’s <em>The Game of Diplomacy</em>, entitled ‘Fundamentals’.<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">26</a></sup> </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-a-discussion-of-experience">A Discussion of Experience</h3>

<p>So much depends on what experience we want new players to have.</p>

<p>Each new player is different, so it can be good to consider sizing up a new player so as to provide for them the best new player offering. </p>

<p>But first, for context, let me share an email I sent the leadership council for the MN Diplomacy Club: </p>

<p>Here’s an email I wrote to our club council leadership about new players’ first few games:</p>

<p><em>start of email</em>  </p>

<p>One thing I’ve observed our group doing well is asking players how the game went, and listening. In the case of Jake P at David’s house, I remember commenting that he took his relatively early defeat (1904/5 I believe) quite well. He even asked me eventually what I thought he could have done better. In reply, I asked him what <em>he</em> thought he could have done better, to encourage him to develop his thinking on the game. He had a few ideas, so that was good.</p>

<p>Last night Owen made a comment about making a mistake as Germany and I did my best to reward him for noticing that he had much to learn. During the game, Jake did a pretty cool thing and interrupted a discussion between he and Owen to advise him on how not to shut the discussion down.</p>

<p>I didn’t ask you guys about this (from a GM influencing the game perspective), but when newer players looked hopeless and were alone at the board last night, I asked them questions like: How are you going to solve your problems? Main idea was to get them to stay engaged in the game and thinking through strategic offers they might make to survive, etc.</p>

<p>I liked Ben’s involving of all players post-game in a discussion about end-of-season awards. </p>

<p>Also, this game probably isn’t for everyone, although I agree we should try to hold interest if there is genuine interest and not crush souls mercilessly (some people just take losses badly, and could still make excellent Diplomacy players).</p>

<p>I do like the two-pronged approach of leveling up our new players and finding existing Diplomacy players in our Minnesota community. Last summer there was a Diplomacy game on my rooftop (which I was not involved in), so there are people underground doing mischevious things. If we can find them. A flyer or sign at our Fantasy Flight games will do nicely. </p>

<p>(One personal goal I have, and maybe you guys share it, is to become a better Diplomacy player…and having top competition helps, ideally 7 very good players every game. For example, if we are going to represent Minnesota well at tournaments, it may help to have the best training we can manage.)</p>

<p>By now you can probably guess my current position on an NPR: I prefer not to have it. </p>

<p>I am also partial against limiting new players to France and Turkey. A bad first game with Turkey is not only bad but probably boring…not a good combo. (I don’t happen to find Turkey boring, but a new player may not recognize this.) As for France…if you have a bad first game, at least you get to sail into the Mid-Atlantic with decent wine and fresh baguettes. </p>

<p>I get the relatively strong defensive positions of F and T, but if we’re looking for new players to survive and have more play, an additional choice might also be Italy. So much depends on the kind of experience we want them to have. </p>

<p>A different approach would be to take an extra 5-10 minutes before game start to suggest 2-3 strategic areas to focus their negotiations in 1901/2/3. </p>

<p>
  <em>end of email</em>
</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-what-is-most-important-to-teach">What is Most Important to Teach?</h3>

<p>You may be tempted to teach newcomers the game all at once. </p>

<p>That would be very hard.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to teach them just the basics. </p>

<p>But even if this is a good approach, what are ‘the basics’?</p>

<p>As we’ve seen, there are numerous dimensions to Diplomacy. Is negotiation skill more important than strategy? Is strategy more important than tactics? Is negotiation more important than tactics? Sometimes, usually, and not always (all at once). If negotiation is more important than tactics, how should one teach negotiation in a short pre-game session? If strategy is most important, which nuggests might be shared with the completely new player?</p>

<p>Jake Langenfeld, part of the MN Diplomacy leadership council, recently shared that the Windy City Weasels take new player integration very seriously. To do so, they have a Newbie Protection Rule. The advantage is new players get a longer (and hopefully better) game. The disadvantage was the metagame surrounding the rule, given that new players weren’t aware of it. </p>

<p>In a recent game of poker, I went all in against a new player’s river bet, and after consideration he incorrectly called. After the hand, I explained to him that I respected him too much not to go all in there. “I hate it when people go easy on me,” I said, and others around the table agreed. Most of us can tell when we’re being “helped” and for anyone with an ounce of competitiveness in their bodies, this approach risks feeling like an insult. </p>

<p>If a Newbie Protection Rule <em>isn’t</em> in play, how are we then to do our best to give newcomers a good first experience? </p>

<p>Again, my baseline on this is that I don’t like to <em>steal someone’s destiny</em>. If someone is going to crash and burn, that might be just fine. You actually don’t know if the experience will enliven them for a return to the arena. As in <em>Minority Report</em>, when in one of the opening scenes, the protagonist catches a ball falling from the table, he doesn’t really know if the ball would have hit the ground (because he caught it). </p>

<p>Another poker analogy serves well here: I’ve been asked by players who fold to my bluffs (or value bets) if, had they raised or gone all-in, if I would have called. My standard response to this is usually, “I don’t know, because you didn’t do it.” </p>

<p>The MN Diplomacy Club has experimented with allowing new players their choice of country, suggesting against the central powers and Russia. Recently, we made the decision to begin new player initiation with an overview of the rules and light strategy for 1901-1902 for each country, and then allow the new player/s to make their country selections first (any power they would like).</p>

<p>We will see how this goes and report back to the Diplomacy community.</p>

<p>In the future, we will as a community be able to consolidate, develop, and share guides and strategies (strategies of teaching) that better acclimate a new player to the game without ruining their first game, giving them a chance for a good experience, get them excited about the game, and also enliven their own spirit of exploration. As I hope has been apparent throughout this book, I am enthusiastic about exploring the unknown territories of Diplomacy and face to face Diplomacy more specifically. If this can be sparked in new players from their first game, all the better.</p>

<p>My favorite games are among 7 very solid Diplomacy players, but new players should be encouraged, because who knows what potential greats are still waiting to play their very first game. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-diplomacy-clubs">Diplomacy Clubs</h3>

<p>Do you run a Diplomacy club? </p>

<p>How do you initiate new players? </p>

<p>How do you ensure new players come back and play again? </p>

<p>How much of the rules do you share? Do you provide examples of supports and support cutting? What about braces, uncuttable supports? </p>

<p>Which elements of strategy do you discuss? Country specific dynamics? Logistics, pace, growth, targets? </p>

<p>What about game flow? Game theory? </p>

<p>Negotiation, psychology, tactics? </p>

<p>I’m very curious. </p>

<p>Please share any ideas you have with erik.vanmechelen@gmail.com</p>
