<h2 id="Negotiation">Chapter 5: Negotiation</h2>

<p>Negotiation is perhaps <em>the</em> skill required to be successful at Diplomacy. Especially face to face Diplomacy.</p>

<p>Paying attention and engaging with your negotiation counterparts is crucial to gaining and transmitting information. To make plans, to achieve them. To spot lies, deception, and misdirection. How something is said matters as much–usually more–than what is said. What is omitted, perhaps greater.</p>

<p>You’ll notice omissions in this chapter. Maybe they will be discussed in the next book…if you spot them.</p>

<p>Let’s get on with it.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-smart-yet-dumb">Smart, Yet Dumb</h3>

<p>How good a strategy is playing dumb, really?</p>

<p>If you’re an unknown quantity and don’t reveal much about your skill, experience, or playing style, how am I to read you? </p>

<p>If you ask questions that suggest inexperience, or openly ask for advice, players will have to take this into account. </p>

<p>Are you opening yourself up as a major target? Perhaps. But maybe you are creating avenues to cooperate with opposing players who like to help new players. Maybe you could collaborate with them a bit, and see how the game progresses.</p>

<p>Andrew Goff mentioned on the Diplomacy Games podcast that in the United States, expressions of authority tend to increase respect and increase the likelihood players will work with you.[foo^1] In other regions of the globe, he suggested such broadcasting has the opposite effect, putting a target on one’s back.</p>

<p>Does the opposite then hold true? </p>

<p>It depends. How much do your opponents respect or disrespect new players? Is this a club game, or a tournament? </p>

<p>My general approach, when in a competitive setting, is <em>not</em> to compensate for the new player. This is not without exceptions. I once merely called a river bet with the nut flush (the bettor was my ride home). I once allowed a new English player to camp their last army in Saint Petersburg for a few game years.</p>

<p>But what of <em>pretending</em> to be new, when in fact you are not?</p>

<p>In a game as difficult as Diplomacy, I think it’s reasonable to express newness for quite some time and for quite a number of games. For instance, when I first began writing this book in March 2019, I was yet to play in a face to face <em>tournament</em>. </p>

<p>How will I present myself at this first tournament, and subsequent tournaments?</p>

<p>Every interaction is an opportunity to establish trust, develop rapport, and avenues for collaboration. </p>

<p>I am likely to tell the truth about my inexperience in tournaments, because any small advantage I might gain from deception (either in over- or under-repping my capability) would likely not match the reputation <em>loss</em> I believe one takes when lying or deceiving unnecessarily. </p>

<p>If someone asks, “Is this your first tournament?”, I’ll likely respond, “Yes, but it isn’t   my first game of Diplomacy.” (“Now, how shall we go about splitting the Balkans?”)</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-slowing-down-to-listen">Slowing Down to Listen</h3>

<p>Actively listening is an interesting skill. I thought I had this skill for years before I realized I didn’t. Funny how that works. </p>

<p>The thing about active listening is this: it works better if we subdue our goal-orientedness, if only momentarily. You can listen very carefully whilst figuring out how to manipulate your opponent. You could listen plainly to what they are saying. You could ask questions, or clarify their statements and sentiments. </p>

<p>“It seems like you are worried I’m going to open to the Channel.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. You mentioned your stance on the Channel repeatedly in your book on Diplomacy.” </p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but it seems like you think that my being in the Channel will lead to me attacking you.”</p>

<p>“Again, that’s right.” </p>

<p>Who knows where this conversation could (or has) gone, but there is incredible potential for further discussion when you can connect with your conversation partner <em>in the moment</em>, and pull them into sync with you. By showing your counterpart that he is being heard, you immediately build trust (even as you discuss the Channel), and that trust could be quite good for both of you.</p>

<p>In this narrow situation of an England-France discussion, neither of you wants to lose an early game tempo over the Channel in Spring 1901. Furthermore, if I am England and face this concern from France, a very bad outcome would be for me to see France decide he can’t trust me and work with Germany against me. Then I’d be relying on good defensive tactics in the short-term and help from Russia in the medium term. I’d rather have either the Frenchman or German on my side, and better not to lose one potential ally before the game even starts because they read my book on Diplomacy.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-north-korean-weapons-technology">North Korean Weapons Technology</h3>

<p>One of my college entrance essays discussed Diplomacy and black holes. (The other was about Samwise Gamgee’s loyalty.) I was asked about the Diplomacy and black holes essay by the professor of International Relations at Saint Olaf College, from whom I later took my first every college course. </p>

<p>During that course in my freshman year, I was to feature in a fictional role-playing of the Six-Way talks. I was representing North Korea. My objectives sheet had some interesting near and long-term goals, including securing foodstuffs as donations from the United States whilst maintaining our research and development of nuclear technology. I remember using my negative leverage–continuing to develop nuclear weapons technologies–to garner additional concessions from my negotiation counterparts. </p>

<p>I remember asking the American representative what would happen if I continued to develop my nuclear capabilities. The individual’s face betrayed the <em>very negative</em> outcome associated with her objectives sheet, but she went on to effectively attempt to dissuade me of my proposed plan. </p>

<p>Of course, this was a little too late. I could see that my negative leverage was quite a bit stronger than her positive leverage. And that, as the negotiations grew tenser and our timing tightened, I didn’t need to make concessions to achieve my best outcomes. </p>

<p>This was an early example in understanding the value of interests, the reliability of threats, and the likelihood of future concessions.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-telling-a-vivid-story">Telling a Vivid Story</h3>

<p>Telling a story that is to be readily believed requires emotional and cognitive resonance. Will other players accept the story you provide for your beliefs? Does it mesh <em>enough</em> with what they believe about the state of the board, the relationships of players, the potentials for growth? </p>

<p>Can you fit <em>into</em> the story they are telling themselves about the game? </p>

<p>For example, you can make an extreme prediction (with little evidence) so long as it fits into the story your counterpart currently has about the game space. </p>

<p>Often, players will use a conclusion from a certain set of an opponent’s moves to argue for collaboration with their neighbor. When the optics of a move suggest a plan, this plan (whether intended or not by that player), can quite vividly be wrapped into a story serving your own needs. (Nevermind that the other player may not be the type to so overtly announce himself with such overt moves.)</p>

<p>If someone is spinning a story, I like to check the validity of my counterpart’s claims by asking questions like: </p>

<p>“Is that really what his moves are saying?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t he have other aims besides those?”</p>

<p>Notice how these questions can be used agnostic of the position. Even if you don’t understand a position strategically (or are actually onboard with your counterpart’s story), these questions will demand a response (or a reaction) from your counterpart. This way, you can discover if your conversational counterpart will stick to his story or dilute his story to account for your doubt. You will occasionally cause a glitch in the dubious frame your opponent is drawing. Good for you, in that case.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-intuition">Intuition</h3>

<p>In a comparative history course my senior year at Saint Olaf College, I assumed the role of an Athenian athlete. I named my character Philokrates–<em>friend of power</em>–after reading my objectives in the ancient Greek role-playing game, <em>The Threshold of Democracy: Athens in 403 BCE (4th Edition)</em>.<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">18</a></sup>  in a separate political science course, wherein I convinced the Athenian assembly to grant me power of the military (which I promptly used to assume control of the city-state). Perhaps they shouldn’t have trusted me.</p>

<p>What the other students lacked–I think–is an intuition for how I would behave in this general context. Few if any had played competitive games with me, or role-playing games, or games of negotiation. For the most part, we had done what most students in college classes do, listen to lectures and occasionally engage in class discussions. Furthermore, the students had their own complicated objectives, and didn’t know to watch out for my hidden objective of using the army to take over the city-state.</p>

<p>As a Diplomacy player, you will develop various kinds of intuition. </p>

<p>The most obvious are those relating to interacting with people. These you will probably come armed with. Most people are reasonably good at spotting discomfort or quirks or ticks in our fellow humans. If you’re not, perhaps look for a <em>lack</em> of comfort in your own feeling. If you are feeling very good, you may have good rapport and good general reason and evidence for continued or future cooperation. </p>

<p>Next, we will have intuitions about negotiation and how a negotiation <em>feels</em> when it is proceeding effectively. If either party becomes defensive, <em>that</em> is the signal something has gone wrong in a previous portion of the negotiation (or in the hidden objectives of either party). </p>

<p>Finally, an intuition about a position will eventually develop over the course of enough games. When I see F MAO and F SPA(sc) I often feel uneasy on behalf of the English. When Germany builds Army Berlin, I’m concerned for Russia (and perhaps England, too, if France is still on the map, as the build seems pro-French). </p>

<p>These intuitions may be less reliable than we might think, since we humans tend to be results-oriented over small sample sizes. For example, when I played my first ten or twenty thousand hands of poker, I developed bad habits in cases where my mathematical mistakes <em>paid off</em> in the wrong way. Of course, I needed to go back and fix those habits later, which was difficult to do. </p>

<p>You may have had a bad experience as Turkey with the Russian in the Black Sea, or as Austria with the Russian in Galicia, whereas another player may have performed much better than you in those same positions for a variety of reasons below the surface-level position. </p>

<p>These lower level intuitions, however, are useful in that they provide mental heuristics to jump-start planning. If you are able to “read” a board quickly, then you will have more time for negotiating ideas and plans. You will also be able to weigh offers and collaboration proposals more accurately in real-time without needing to refer back to the board or calculate 2 or 3 seasons ahead. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-anticipatory-regret">Anticipatory Regret</h3>

<p>There are things you’d like to do, such as exercise, which you know you will not have done enough of 10 years from now. </p>

<p>Even now, you already can feel a little regret having not done them. </p>

<p>All it took was for you to read those words, nod your head, and <em>there</em> is the regret. </p>

<p>This in effect is an exercise in counterfactual thinking.</p>

<p>Let me put this to you from a Diplomacy perspective. </p>

<p>“You don’t want to end this turn on four dots.”</p>

<p>OR </p>

<p>“Will you feel good if he takes the North Sea from you?” </p>

<p>These kinds of questions should put in mind the likely counterfactual bad result, but also they may trigger anticipatory regret. <em>No, I won’t like it if he takes the North Sea one bit!</em> your English counterpart may be thinking, in response to your question about the German fleet in Helgoland Bight. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-appeals-to-fairness-and-center-count-parity">Appeals to Fairness and Center Count Parity</h3>

<p>Because of the natural <a href="chap04.html#Inequality">Inequality</a> in the game of Diplomacy, it is rare to find a game where multiple powers are on the same center count. Usually, one or two powers have an edge. Even though everyone knows that everyone else is trying to get to 18 (or at least more than he has at the moment), an appeal to fairness can be effective in several ways. </p>

<p>When negotiation collaborations, ask: “Is it good for us if England goes up 2 and we both stay even?” OR “What happens if Austria goes down 2?”</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-collaborative-language">Collaborative Language</h3>

<p>I learned to watch out for the aggressive use of ‘we’ when I read Christopher Hitchens’ <em>Letters to a Young Contrarian</em>. Who exactly is using this ‘we’ and how did you become wrapped up in it? More than likely, your counterpart is using this language so as to maintain rapport with you, or a relationship, or an expectation. This could be a promising signal.</p>

<p>Maybe you can use this language yourself. </p>

<p>But be careful. <em>Overusing</em> ‘we’ like this feels off, at least to some players. Many people want to maintain autonomy over their actions. If you’re negotiation with me, I want you to occasionally ask me, “What do you want to do?” or “What do you want to happen?” Even if you have adversarial ideas, this is probably more effective than overusing ‘we’, since at minimum you are acknowledging my existence as an autonomous individual, and secondly, you are asking questions about my <em>interests</em>. These interests can be used to better negotiate with me moving forward, both as positive or negative leverage.</p>

<p>The last paragraph withstanding, speaking in a collaborative manner to maintain a positive relationship tends to be taken favorably by a certain category of player. Using ‘we’ and ‘our’ should probably be a <em>part</em> of your conversational repertoire.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-what-you-measure-matters">What You Measure Matters</h3>

<p>The strength of a position is not explicitly measured in a game of Diplomacy. No metric exists to say that Russia, even though he is only on 5 centers, actually has very good winning chances in this position. </p>

<p>It takes a mixture of intuition, calculation, and persuasion to make such a case. If you <em>are</em> the Russian on 5 centers with a dynamic and high-growth-potential position, you may at times downplay this. Your opponents, if they understand a positional advantage that you’ve achieved, may attempt to make this “fact” (or story) vivid in other players’ minds. </p>

<p>Consider the following scenario. </p>

<p>You’re Russia on 5 centers. You’ve lost Saint Petersburg to England, but have a fairly good relationship with the Prime Minister and have seen to it that he is entangled with France and Germany. The West is balanced in a favorable way for you, because you are focused for the moment in the south. Maybe your preferred medium or long-term partner is Italy in this game, but you’ve positioned yourself for advances in either Austria or Turkey. </p>

    <img src="images/goodrussia5.png" alt="A strong Russian position." style="width: 100%;" />
    <figcaption>A strong Russian position.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>I haven’t even mentioned your fleet in the Black Sea yet, which is pretty amazing. I might even be happy in this position on four centers (without Rumania). </p>

<p>Maybe I’m overvaluing the Black Sea. But maybe I’m <em>undervaluing</em> it. I might even be happy with a 3-center Russia if I have the Black Sea. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-accommodator-assertive-analyst">Accommodator, Assertive, Analyst</h3>

<p>These three types of negotiators, as described by Chris Voss and Tahl Raz in <em>Never Split the Difference</em>, can be useful in categorizing players in Diplomacy, too. </p>

<p>Be forewarned, it is not sufficient to label a player as a certain type. One must be vigilant in watching them, especially if they have chameleon-like features and capabilities (most good negotiators do). </p>

<p>Additionally, these negotiator types interplay with a player’s overall philosophy of play, and furthermore their strategy in a particular game. Seek to understand someone’s religion, and language, and speak it with them. Good luck making sense of all this. But if you spend the attention and effort to create these models and adjust them in real-time, you could see incredible benefits. Collaborations, deals, and swindles you never thought possible. </p>

<p><strong>Accommodator</strong> “The most important thing to this type of negotiator is the time spent building the relationship. Accommodators think as long as there is a free-flowing continuous exchange of information time is being well spent. As long as they’re communicating, they’re happy. Their goals is to be on great terms with their counterpart. They love the win-win. Of the three types, they are most likely to build great rapport without actually accomplishing anything.”</p>

<p>If you’re an Accommodator, be mindful not to be bulldozed into a disadvantageous (or disingenuous) collaboration or short-term alliance. Instead, capitalize on your skills in building relationships to then move on your own offers and allegiances. </p>

<p>Thinking back to the Big Five personality traits discussed in <a href="chap05.html#Psychology">Psychology</a>, we can surmise that some Accommodators likely have more compassion than Assertives or Analysts. This comes in handy, for example, in expressing sincere regret for the plight of a two-center power–a useful way to get the down-and-out. While others are surely negotiating for control of those same units, you’ll have an edge in your ability to communicate this compassion.</p>

<p><strong>Assertive</strong>: “The Assertive type believes time is money; every wasted minute is a wasted dollar. Their self-image is linked to how many things they can get accomplished in a period of time. For them, getting the solution perfect isn’t as important as getting it done. </p>

<p>This style can work well in face to face Diplomacy where time is a <em>real</em> factor. Having a plan–when other players don’t–helps create move-sets that (while perhaps tactically dubious) actually coordinate with other players and take advantage of the overall board’s relative lack of confidence. Assertive players may look for an Accommodator as an ally, which can be bad news for the rest of the board. </p>

<p><strong>Analyst</strong>: “Analysts are methodical and diligent. They are not in a big rush. Instead, they believe that as long as they are working toward the best result in a thorough and systematic way, time is of little consequence. This self-image is linked to minimizing mistakes. Their motto: As much time as it takes to get it right.” </p>

<p>If you’re an analyst, you might to well to take the approach–described in <a href="chap08.html#Strategy">Strategy</a> of writing down your orders before negotiating, so as to give yourself time to think over the board before taking on new information through your conversations with other players. That silence, while other players begin their negotiations, is your moment to figure out the best possible approach to this and upcoming seasons.</p>
