<h2 id="Morality">Chapter 4: Morality</h2>

<p>Does morality really have a place in a game of intrigue, deception, and underhanded dealings?</p>

<p>I put to you that, yes, it does. </p>

<p>In his essay, <em>Lying</em>, neuroscientist and philosopher Sam Harris argues that “Lying is the royal road to chaos.”<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> In a discussion of lying’s short and long term consequences, Harris recounts the socratic conversation carried on between he and his professor in a college course entitled ‘The Ethical Analyst’ where the question <em>Is it wrong to lie?</em> was discussed for the entire semester.</p>

<p>The author came away “convinced that lying, even about the smallest matters, needlessly damages personal relationships and public trust.”  </p>

<p>Is it possible not to lie throughout an entire game of Diplomacy, and still do well?</p>

<p>Surely it is, although such a feat may require careful omissions and avoidance of various topics with collaborators-cum-targets. When you put the knife in, and explain to your former ally that you never lied to him, he probably will not let you off the hook for the stab. </p>

<p>It is common, too, to see top level players use phrasing akin to “let’s talk about that in the spring” or “I think that conversation is premature” to either reframe discussions, delay them, or avoid having to lie. </p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve used similar conversation tactics yourself.</p>

<p>From this perspective, we can already see that agreeing to answer a question you don’t want to answer, and answering it in such a way that will soon reveal you to have lied, is not such a great decision in many scenarios. </p>

<p>Even in a game where lying is permitted, we don’t want to be known as a player who frequently lies (at least who frequently lies unnecessarily). </p>

<p>We might amend the initial claim as follows: It is possible to do well in Diplomacy without lying, but deception and misdirection and the element of surprise are required.  </p>

<p>We will cover these deceptions in the context of a discussion on morality as well.</p>

<p>While lying is an area where our moral sensibilities about how to act in society actually map on reasonably well to the game of Diplomacy, there are a few other areas where they do not. These categories will be discussed as well.</p>

<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it (at least Aristotle stated as much). May you entertain the ideas in this chapter. Afterward, you may discard them.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-lying">Lying</h3>

<p>In the introduction to <em>Lying</em>, Harris discusses the difference between outright lies and deception. For instance, he discusses the wearing of cosmetics, the hurried person pretending not to notice an acquaintance passing in the street, or a polite host not calling out a guest’s silly statement in front of others. In these cases, Harris argues, we are skirting the truth, but at least we do not “deliberately manufacture falsehood or conceal important facts to the detriment of others.”<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<p>Here is a definition of lying: <em>to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.</em></p>

<p>Does this let Diplomacy players off the hook? </p>

<p>Perhaps. </p>

<p>Such a definition surely gives us pause to think over how lying affects the relationships between players, the overall approach to the game, and from a larger perspective the affect of lying on the game of Diplomacy in general.</p>

<p>It is arguable whether at any moment in the course of conversations with other players that one should <em>expect</em> honest communication. </p>

<p>Perhaps a progression of a Diplomacy player with respect to lying goes like this:</p>

<p><strong>The Naive Diplomacy Player</strong>: Expects honest communication, most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>The Cynical Diplomacy Player</strong>: Expects to be lied too often.</p>

<p><strong>The Courageous Diplomacy Player</strong>: Expects honest communication, most of the time, and stays alert to cues he is being lied to. Doesn’t enjoy being lied to, and occasionally uses being lied to as punishment for the liar as well as leverage with other players.</p>

<p>In <a href="chap08.html#Strategy">Strategy</a> and <a href="chap07.html#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> I’ll argue that the best face to face players are mostly operating as <strong>Courageous Diplomacy Players</strong>, communicating honestly on the whole, expecting that from others. In other words, such players are consistently extending hands of trust. If they were not, they wouldn’t be so ticked off when they are lied to.</p>

<p>There is a larger discussion to be had around knowing the situations in which one may be lied to. </p>

<p>Generally speaking, watch out for lies in strategically pivotal moments of the game.</p>

<p>As to how to notice these, continue reading into the chapter on <a href="chap08.html#Strategy">Strategy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-deception-and-misdirection">Deception (and Misdirection)</h3>

<p>Here we might return to a discussion of lying versus misdirection. </p>

<p>Sewing seeds of doubt in a player as to the intentions of his ally is regarded as good strategy. And often necessary. </p>

<p>Is this even deceiving? Only, it seems, if you are aware of what each individual in the pair of allies is actually thinking. That’s hard to do be sure of, isn’t it? In this case, your suggestion and planting of seeds of doubt may actually be accurate information. Yes, you are doing such a thing for your own strategic advantage, as is the case for almost everything one does in a game of Diplomacy.  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-spectrums-of-the-moral-compass">Spectrums of the Moral Compass</h3>

<p>A sense of right and wrong guides nuances of my negotiation tactics. Player preferences and sensibilities may allow one player to take an action that another would frown upon. The fact that the second player frowns upon it (even if the tactic is not strictly disallowed in the rules of Diplomacy) suggests a moral question. </p>

<p>For someone of my temperament, who perhaps values honor and integrity slightly more than average, the action taken by the first player (should I learn of it) may devalue in some–however small–way my future interactions. This may hurt me in future games, or it may help. It is all very hard to say, as various other factors might influence those future interactions and games.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-norms-in-face-to-face-diplomacy">Norms in Face to Face Diplomacy</h3>

<p>Are there norms that generally guide face to face Diplomacy? Here are several I have noticed, observed, or actively discussed. </p>

<p>Perhaps listing potential Norms gives a place to evaluate how morality affects the game. If indeed, it should at all.  </p>

<p>
  <em>It is not okay to deceive the Game Master (GM)</em>
</p>

<p>Unless agreed upon by the players pre-game.</p>

<p>
  <em>Lying, deception, and misdirection are generally within bounds.</em>
</p>

<p>As discussed, needlessly lying generally isn’t a good long-term strategy.</p>

<p>
  <em>Players should write their own orders.</em>
</p>

<p>Part of the enjoyment of Diplomacy is writing one’s <em>own</em> orders. Sure, another player may assist you, or even influence you. But a player should not be (or allow themselves to be) persuaded or coerced into having another player write their orders for them.</p>

<p>A larger discussion might then be had around taking <em>ownership</em> for the game before you, and the responsibility one has to play as well as they can within the context of available options, outcomes, including meta game.</p>

<p>
  <em>Players should finish games they start.</em>
</p>

<p>Giving up is a psychological pitfall we all have, and must avoid. Diplomacy can appear ruthless, but taking things personally may diminish your ability to perform well, especially in cases where secondary goals must be adopted to survive (when you have become a target). </p>

<p>Outright leaving or quitting a game should be avoided. It ruins the fun for the rest of the board.</p>

<p>
  <em>Competition and collaboration are encouraged.</em>
</p>

<p>Diplomacy involves both, separately and at the same time. </p>

<p>
  <em>Kingmaking is acceptable.</em>
</p>

<p>Especially on Top Boards, Kingmaking is acceptable, although players differ on whether it is good strategic play or not. (Since Kingmaking is acceptable, the <em>threat</em> of Kingmaking becomes a reliable threat diplomatically.)</p>

<p>
  <em>Throwing a game is acceptable.</em>
</p>

<p>Here we have another area where views differ.</p>

<p>
  <em>Spying is acceptable.</em>
</p>

<p>Listening into another’s conversation is acceptable. I may prefer, from an etiquette standpoint, that you approach me and ask for a word, but if I am speaking very loudly and you happen to hear me from across the room, that is probably my fault for speaking to boisterously. (Watch out: maybe I wanted you to hear me.)</p>

<p>
  <em>Illegal retreats should not be tolerated.</em>
</p>

<p>In games on the clock, illegal retreats are sometimes mis-adjudicated, but these are frowned upon given the Diplomacy rules.</p>

<p>
  <em>If someone reveals their orders during order writing, that is on them.</em>
</p>

<p>In poker, if while checking your cards I see them, I tend to notify the player and suggest they keep their cards to themselves. </p>

<p>In Diplomacy, I follow this same etiquette. I can’t disremember what I saw, but I can inform you of your carelessness for the future.</p>

<p>In tournaments using a drop-dead clock, this likely does not apply.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-assessing-your-moral-sensibilities">Assessing Your Moral Sensibilities</h3>

<p>Where do you stand on questions of right and wrong in a game of Diplomacy? Have you ever wavered, by your <em>own</em> standards?</p>

<p>What would you do if you saw an order you weren’t meant to see, 10 seconds before orders are due? </p>

<p>If you could get away with it, would you attempt an illegal retreat? </p>

<p>What is most interesting to me is the discussion around lying, deception, and misdirection. Why do some players applaud incredible and elaborate lies while others frown upon their apparent effectiveness? Why are erratic truth-tellers described as both fun to play with and inviting a target upon their backs?</p>
