<h2 id="Philosophy">Chapter 1: Philosophy</h2>

<p>In the past year or so I’ve adopted the view that I might take more responsibility for how things are going in my life than I’ve previously done.</p>

<p>This was and continues to be difficult. One constantly sees the mistakes, frailties, and flaws. Regrets are psychologically painful. This stresses the body and mind in a dangerous feedback loop (much like the one that saw Italian strategy in the doldrums for decades). But if you look long enough into the abyss, there is something to be found. In filth it will be found (In sterquilinus invenitur).<sup id="fnref-foo9"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Literally, if you eat shit for awhile, you <em>might</em> learn something. No guarantees, though, and that’s the gamble of F Den-SKA in Spring 1902.  </p>

<p>While I tried to take on the model that everything I do matters, the reality was different.</p>

<p>The reality, right now, seems more like a super-position of a) everything I do matters, and b) things don’t matter as much as I think. </p>

<p>Perhaps I’ve taken this position as a result of scoring somewhat above average for Neuroticism on the Big 5 personality assessment (I am more affected than average by negative emotion): I have to protect myself <em>somehow</em>. Thus, the super-position of things mattering and not mattering. As I learn to <em>let go</em> of perceived mistakes, learn from them, and move on, I hope I will be able to shift the way I act in the world more toward ‘everything I do matters’. </p>

<p>If everything I do matters, and it feels like I should spend more time playing Diplomacy, and becoming a better Diplomacy player, then I better have a working justification for that.  </p>

<p>The prospect of creating this framework is tricky, because in developing a philosophy of Diplomacy in conjunction with this intent, I <em>could</em> let intellect and reason weigh in more than they should. Just as trying to describe the true experience would require a novel-length after-action report, there is danger in trying to summarize too neatly the path I’d like to walk.  </p>

<p>It isn’t obvious that playing more Diplomacy coincides with living my best life, but nor is it obvious that England should open more regularly to the English Channel.  </p>

<p>There is a case to be made that how I approach life should be agnostic (or irrelevant) toward building a philosophy of Diplomacy, or in developing a plan to become a better Diplomacy player.  </p>

<p>And then there is the fact that I am writing this book. Sometimes leaps of, can I say ‘faith’?, are necessary.  </p>

<p>In either case, this is partly why I begin with questions. This way at least I don’t make the first bad move of the game.  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-diplomacy-as-ritual">Diplomacy as Ritual</h3>

<p>Let me take a moment to comment on the hobby. </p>

<p>For decades now enthusiasts have met in garages, gardens, and grand hotel conference rooms to play a game of Diplomacy. Or better still, to participate in a tournament.</p>

<p>For the most part, these events are self-organizing. Sure, it helps to have a strong core of skilled event planners, passionate recruiters, and tournament directors among them, but these events have largely gone on with very little if any advertising and promotion. </p>

<p>As is impressed upon in Maps of Meaning, we act out and ritualize before we explicitly understand or are able to codify in language what we know. <sup id="fnref-foo10"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Diplomacy is a version of this acting out. From one lens, Diplomacy is a ritual of several kinds of negotiation: conflict resolution, creative problem solving, trust and relationship building, distribution of resources, a handing out of mercy or justice, sacrifice, collaboration and competition in an environment of scarcity, to name but a few.  </p>

<p>These are all very good for the deepest parts of ourselves…for negotiation is always what we are doing, in a sense…we are always aiming, calibrating our aim, taking in new information, and getting others to join us in taking aim yet again at the next target.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-pennies-a-simple-version-of-the-game">34 Pennies: A Simple Version of the Game</h3>

<p>There are 34 pennies on a wooden table.</p>

<p>7 people are here, too. </p>

<p>Each person holds 3 (or 4) of the 34 pennies (the Russian gets 4). The remaining 12 pennies are scattered on the table’s grainy and uneven surface. </p>

<p>The game is to persuade the others to let you have 18 of the 34. </p>

<p>Already, this is a pretty interesting game. How will you divide the 12 unowned pennies? And, once that feat is completed, how on earth will you persuade the others to give you their pennies, particularly the shiny ones!</p>

<p>This basic model, of course, leaves out the territorial and resource component of the game.</p>

<p>Once we integrate the spatial relationships and economy, we get the constraints of positioning, logistics, and tempo. Unlike poker, in Diplomacy I cannot go completely on tilt and dump 8 pennies into your waiting hands. We would both have to be in position to make such an exchange, and other players are unlikely to allow it.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-a-relationship-with-the-game">A Relationship with the Game</h3>

<p>I’m still in the process of figuring out what Diplomacy and being a Diplomacy player means to me. Where on the continuum of recreation to competitive do I position myself? </p>

<p>This question remains unanswered.</p>

<p>One parallel I have drawn is this:</p>

<p>In the fall of 2018 I made re-acquaintance with a negotiations expert throwing around the idea of writing a strategic negotiations book. I took interest. </p>

<p>Less than a month later, I noticed a Minneapolis Meetup for Diplomacy. I had wanted to but failed to play face to face Diplomacy since I was 16 years old, and had recently retired from competitive soccer. Like two prerequisites for a good stab, the position and timing were good.</p>

<p>Ben Johnson and Jake Langenfeld held a great game, showing generosity to new players and a good game flow. I had fun. And although I rose to a 9-center Russia, my temptations ruined my patient early game. Nevertheless, I was hooked again.</p>

<p>I played a few more face to face games in late 2018 and in early 2019, in what is now the second season of the Minnesota Diplomacy Club, of which I’m a council member. I asked the Club President, Ben Johnson, what his hopes were for the club, and when he responded “I want this club to be the best Diplomacy club in the world”, I was persuaded.<sup id="fnref-foo11"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>  </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-asking-the-right-questions">Asking the Right Questions</h3>

<p>If you haven’t attempted the questions posed in the <a href="chap00.html#Overture">Overture</a>, give it a go. Unlike Spring 1902 tactics in the Balkans, I can all but guarantee the exercise will illuminate insights within you. Shine enough light, and from enough angles, and breakthroughs are possible.  </p>

<p>What sort of game is Diplomacy, really?</p>

<p>Given that, what combination of attributes, skills, and mentality would I expect are required to be successful as a player in that game?</p>

<p>Then, try these slightly easier ones:  </p>

<p>What are my lifetime goals within the hobby? (What is Diplomacy to you? An interest, a hobby, a passion, a calling?)</p>

<p>What characteristics do I respect in an opponent? </p>

<p>If I hold grudges against a certain opponent, for what reasons do I hold them?</p>

<p>What reputation would I ideally have as a Diplomacy player?</p>

<p>Answering these questions suggests underlying beliefs and values, and hint at the model which you have constructed for what Diplomacy is and represents for you, and how you play within that space.</p>

<aside>
  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-early-responses-to-hard-questions">Early Responses to Hard Questions</h4>

  <p><em>What sort of game is Diplomacy, really?</em></p>

  <p>A negotiations-driven allocation of scarce resources.<br />
 Or, perhaps: a negotiation-based psychological struggle for territorial influence.  </p>

  <p><em>Given that, what combination of attributes, skills, and mentality would I expect are required to be successful as a player in that game?</em>  </p>

  <p>Game theory and modeling; Psychological persuasion; Emotional control;  Creative problem-solving  </p>

  <p><em>What are my lifetime goals within the hobby? (What is Diplomacy to you? An interest, a hobby, a passion, a calling?)</em>  </p>

  <p>World Champion; US Champion; Minnesota Club Champion; Top Board at Major Tournament; Significant Contributor to strategy conversation &amp; writing; Make every tournament I go to more fun and meaningful than it otherwise might have been; improve the overall quality of every game I am in  </p>

  <p><em>What characteristics do I respect in an opponent?</em>  </p>

  <p>Characteristics I respect: joy in playing the game; passion, regardless position in a game; openness to ideas, offers, and general negotiation savvy; keen eye for creativity, when needed; sound understanding of fundamentals; harmony between seriousness, steadfastness, play, and humor; authenticity  </p>


</aside>

<p>I will need some more time to craft why I might hold grudges as well as what my ideal reputation would be.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-problems">99 Problems</h4>

<p>Did you really expect to meet <em>no</em> resistance on your way to an 18-center solo. Of course not. (Getting to 6 centers is often a challenge in itself!) </p>

<p>Problems, or, as some prefer–puzzles–are inherent to Diplomacy. A position is on the board. And it poses problems to you. </p>

<p>Then there are your fellow diplomats, who will bring their own challenges. Personalities, emotional reactions, unusual negotiation strategies, gimmicks, unnecessary misdirection, the list goes on. You are like a business operator constantly putting out fires. Even when you can effectively manage one problem, sparks fly on other borders. </p>

<p>May I ask what you would do if none of these problems existed? </p>

<p>But you already know the answer: You wouldn’t be playing the game of Diplomacy. Without the nearly insurmountable challenge of navigating six other humans, each with non-aligning end-goals to your own, each with varying levels of skill and approach and style, the game would not be engaging. A diplomacy <em>player</em>, however, relishes each of the plentiful categories of problems he may face. Positional, relational, strategic. Usually each of these, all at once. </p>

<p>Here again we see Diplomacy’s mirroring of life. If we had no problems, would we really enjoy ourselves? Maybe for a short while, but most likely not for very long. We are not far from beasts of burden. Show me a burden and tell me which hill I need to climb.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-further-discussion-and-writing">Further Discussion and Writing</h4>

<p>Clearly, I need more experience, time, and conversation with other Diplomacy players to develop these ideas and considerations. </p>

<p>I hope, in the meantime, that you carry on your own adventure in developing a philosophy of Diplomacy. It might just help you become a better Diplomacy player. </p>

<p>Additionally, in future writings I’d like to comment more on the abstract building blocks and relationships of what Diplomacy is as a game. Who knows, this may help us extract new insights about the game and what we are doing here. Just like people don’t really have ideas (ideas have people), I fear that we may not be playing Diplomacy: Diplomacy may be playing <em>us</em>. </p>

<p>Last but not least, I am curious to understand more about mindset and attitude. While I may discuss these in <a href="chap05.html#Psychology">Psychology</a>, I wonder how much these derive or interact with a player’s philosophy of Diplomacy.</p>
