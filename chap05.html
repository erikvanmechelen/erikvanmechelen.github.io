<h2 id="Psychology">Chapter 3: Psychology</h2>

<p>An understanding of psychology is integral to your success in Diplomacy. Especially face to face Diplomacy.</p>

<p>The best players have a feel for their opponents’ playing styles, motivations, and intended actions. They know what to ask their opponents when they notice inconsistencies or hesitation, and they know how to ask those questions. </p>

<p>These nuances have been discussed elsewhere, and perhaps will find their way into a subsequent book. This further discussion of might include opponent modeling, player expectations, and behavioral motivation.</p>

<p>For now, and in this book, I want to focus on these areas: </p>

<p>Game Theory</p>

<p>Personality Types (to be built on further in the chapter on Negotiation).</p>

<p>The psychological power of the truth.</p>

<p>Forecasting.</p>

<p>The value of persistence.</p>

<p>Let’s get started with Game Theory.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-game-theory">Game Theory</h3>

<p>Game theory is a branch of decision theory focusing on interactive decisions, applicable whenever the actions of two or more decision makers jointly determine an outcome that affects them all.</p>

<p>Diplomacy is not a game of chance, but it is a game where chances have to be taken. </p>

<p>Risk without dice? Sort of, but not really. I wouldn’t compare Risk to Diplomacy in this manner, because a description misses important mechanisms and flavors of both games.</p>

<p>If we think back to the 34 Pennies version of the game I provided in <a href="chap03.html#Philosophy">Philosophy</a>, we might observe again the kind of game Diplomacy really is. </p>

<p>And then we can add on a few dimensions and elements. Diplomacy is <em>slightly</em> more than a distribution of pennies between evolved primates.</p>

<p>In addition to a distribution and accumulation (and trading) of supply centers, we have also: </p>

<p>A method of acquiring and trading. </p>

<p>A system of accounting that tracks the 34 resources in the economy and simultaneously allows units with differing properties (armies and fleets) to move about an environment.</p>

<p>The conflict of these units creates opportunities for discussion, debate, and deliberation of their most efficient and effective uses, and for <em>whom</em>, this turn and in future turns. </p>

<p>Decided game type and duration matter: A player need not <em>average</em> the most supply centers over the course of a game, but needs only <em>finish</em> the game with the most supply centers, or 18. </p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-spring-and-fall">Spring and Fall</h4>

<p>In Spring we take our chances, and in Fall we hunker down for winter.<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>If you take seriously Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect theory, you may notice your fellow players behaving differently in Spring to Fall seasons. </p>

<p>More risk seeking on gains. </p>

<p>More risk averse on losses. </p>

<p>Players tend to make mistakes defensively because they are overly risk averse. If you notice this tendency in a player, you may be able to take advantage tactically. If this player is <em>you</em>, consider leveling up to better defensive tactics from a probabilistic perspective.</p>

<p>For example, here’s a new Turkish player’s mistake I witnessed. Notice how he holds in Ankara to avoid the Russian F Arm-Ank, but allows Russia to take the Black Sea combined with A Sev-Arm!</p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 260px;">
    <img src="images/newturkey.png" alt="Turkey plays too passively in defense." style="width: 100%;" />
    <figcaption>Turkey plays too passively in defense.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>If the Turk was to consider the situation from the Russian point of view, he would hold <em>less</em> of the time. </p>

<p>Russia knew the Turk was a new player, and understood that if he could gain the Black Sea and Armenia, he could force Ankara in the next year. Armed with this perception, he would only try F Arm-Ank <em>seldomly</em>, and only when he had suspicion that this very new player would notice the attack that was coming the next season after Russia took the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The Turkish player should <em>at least</em> have tried F Ank-Arm to avoid being doubled the next season. For what it’s worth, there was also an Italian army convoying to Syria, so the situation was dire to begin with. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-personality-types">Personality Types</h3>

<p>Diplomacy is largely about the people in the specific game you find yourself. How you navigate the personalities, styles, and strategies that arise out of this alchemy increases (or decreases) your probability of success. </p>

<p>Can you predict how certain people will react too good and bad news? Can you establish plans, thwart others’, and profitability defend, attack, and position yourself for good mid-game opportunities and end-game outcomes? </p>

<p>I’ve heard it said that Diplomacy is a game for nerdy extroverts. This may be true, true partially, or far from sufficient. We would first need to define nerdy (passionate about something) and extrovert (outgoing, gregarious, conversational, drawing energy from social relations). This seems fine so far, although I don’t think a baseline level of natural extraversion is required to be successful in Diplomacy. (You <em>do</em> need to be good at talking to people, though, even if it isn’t your natural tendency. I believe introverts can easily find ways to keep the game interesting enough to put up with the need to talk to others.)</p>

<p>Let’s step back, though. Extraversion, if we take the classic Big Five personality traits theory, is only one of the five dimensions.<sup id="fnref-foo2"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo2" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> </p>

<p>Here are all five: Openness to Experience; Conscientiousness; Agreeableness; Extraversion; Neuroticism.</p>

<p><strong>Openness to Experience</strong> refers to one’s creativity, artistic interest and intelligence (particularly verbal intelligence) in the Big Five personality trait scientific model.</p>

<p><strong>Conscientiousness</strong> refers to dutiful achievement, and is a measure of obligation, attention to detail, hard work, persistence, cleanliness, efficiency and adherence to rules, standards and processes. Conscientious people implement their plans and establish and maintain order.</p>

<p><strong>Agreeableness</strong> is a dimension of interpersonal interaction, combining compassion and politeness, making it a complex trait given positive and negative elements along its distribution. </p>

<p><strong>Extraversion</strong> is the primary dimension of <em>positive</em> emotion. Extraversion is a measure of general sensitivity to positive emotions such as hope, joy, anticipation and approach, particularly in social situations.  </p>

<p><strong>Neuroticism</strong> is the primary dimension of <em>negative</em> emotion. It is a measure of general sensitivity to negative emotions such as pain, sadness, irritable or defensive anger, fear and anxiety.</p>

<p>I do want to make a larger point about understanding <em>negotiation</em> styles, but only after wrapping up this closer look at just a few of my results from this personality test.</p>

<p>Now, what follows may be very interesting to me (it’s about me), while quite boring for you. At minimum, you will be able to either use this against me or better communicate with me in the next game or tournament we play. </p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at Agreeableness. Here’s an excerpt from my report on understandmyself.com. </p>

<p>
  <em>People high in agreeableness are nice: compliant, nurturing, kind, naively trusting and conciliatory. However, because of their tendency to avoid conflict, they often dissemble and hide what they think. People low in agreeableness are not so nice: stubborn, dominant, harsh, skeptical, competitive and, in the extreme, even predatory. However, they tend to be straightforward, even blunt, so you know where they stand.</em>
</p>

<p>However, according to my test results, I score lower in Agreeableness:</p>

<p>
  <em>People with low levels of agreeableness are seen by others as competitive, colder, tougher and less empathic. They are less likely to look for the best in others, and are not particularly tolerant (an attitude that is much valued by agreeable people). They are less concerned about the emotional state of others, are willing to engage in conflict, and will sacrifice peace and harmony to make a point or (if conscientious) to get things done. People find them straightforward, even blunt. They strongly tend towards dominance rather than submission (particularly if also below average in neuroticism).</em>
</p>

<p>In my case, I have moderate compassion and very low politeness.</p>

<p>On compassion: </p>

<p>
  <em>People who are typically compassionate people are reasonably interested in the problems of other people, and other living things. They are somewhat concerned about helping other people avoid negative emotion, but are willing to stand their ground, even when others get upset. They make time and do kind things for others, but balance that with fulfilling their own needs and interests. They have a soft side, but are not pushovers. Other people consider them reasonably sympathetic and nice, and will sometimes turn to them for a listening ear. They can be empathetic and caring. However, they are not primarily other-oriented, so they can negotiate effectively on their own behalf. This helps ensure that they get what they deserve, and shields them from the development of resentment.</em>
</p>

<p>On politeness:</p>

<p>
  <em>People who are very low in politeness are not at all deferential to authority – nor are they obedient. They can be respectful, grudgingly, but only to people who clearly deserve and demand it, and they are very markedly willing to push back when challenged. They are not uncomfortable confronting other people – in fact, they may enjoy it. People very low in politeness are not motivated to avoid conflict, or to steer clear of conflict or fights. They may find themselves frequently in trouble with authority, in consequence. Their skepticism can make it very difficult for them to find a place in the middle or lower in hierarchies of power and dominance. They tend very strongly to be dominant, rather than submissive (particularly if they are also low in neuroticism).</em>
</p>

<p>What can we take away from this? </p>

<p>In <a href="chap07.html#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> we can extract several negotiation styles from the above personality types. Often, you can identify how people negotiate within a few conversations (or less), but it <em>can</em> be useful to understand how those styles are underpinned.</p>

<p>For example, we will learn about the broad category of Assertive styles. Even if an opponent is assertive, she may well <em>also</em> be moderately agreeable, perhaps combining compassion (which helps collaboration) with a tinge of impoliteness (which helps in understanding what she wants and forming firm plans that won’t be backed out of). We will also look at Analytical and Accommodating styles in the chapter on <a href="#Negotiations">Negotiations</a>.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-our-relationship-to-the-truth">Our Relationship to the Truth</h3>

<p>There is psychological power in truth-telling. Just <em>knowing</em> when someone is telling the truth matters. And is comforting. (Especially when everyone else seems to be lying.) </p>

<p>To build on this, I would also like to discuss the myth that you must lie or deceive to be successful in Diplomacy. </p>

<p>There is incredible psychological power in the truth. There is a myth that you have to tell lies or you have to deceive to win at Diplomacy.</p>

<p>Even though lies and deception are effective, as they are in real life, they are not the <em>most</em> effective approach. </p>

<p>What is effective is inspiring confidence through truth-telling. Making good plans that benefit two or more players (including yourself), and following through forthrightly on those plans. </p>

<p>Now, Diplomacy is a strange game in some ways. Notwithstanding my <a href="chap00.html#Overture">Overture</a>, perhaps it is a little “zero-summy” for my liking. As someone who believes in value creation through discussion and exploration of interests and creative problem-solving, it is disappointing at times to see only 34 supply centers available on the map, no matter how long the game runs.</p>

<p>But we need not deceive or stab so long as we are open with collaboration partners. Some players prefer to refer to their collaboration partners as allies. This may not be an accurate categorization. Can you really be an <em>ally</em> in a race to 18 of 34 supply centers? Maybe you can be a temporary ally, you might argue. And that might be a good argument to have sometime. </p>

<p>I’d rather go forward with the open intention that I am going for 18 centers. I expect you to have that aim as well. In that sense, we cannot be allies. But the fact that we cannot be allies certainly does not prevent us from mutually working toward valuable goals, diminishing our targets and advancing our causes.</p>

<p>At some moment there is a pivot point at which our collaboration, if our individual goals remain to achieve 18 centers, is less profitable than a shift to other collaboration partners offers.</p>

<p>It is in this way that the truth remains a very powerful approach, even in Diplomacy. </p>

<p>One player I’ve observed at length albeit at a distance–through Chris Martin’s video series of the WDC 2016–is Andrew Goff. I challenge you to find areas where he is not forthright in his negotiations. (I haven’t played with him, so those who have will be able to attest better than I.) When he is leaving himself open for a stab, for example, he confronts his neighbors to encourage them <em>not</em> to do so, with good reasons and psychological persuasion. </p>

<p>It is a thing of beauty to watch, and I suspect it is no accident he has done so incredibly well at major tournaments, including winning three world championships. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-forecasting-neither-slave-nor-tyrant">Forecasting: Neither Slave Nor Tyrant</h3>

<p>Would you rather be a slave or the tyrant? </p>

<p>It turns out, you may be one in the same, or both simultaneously.</p>

<p>Let’s begin internally: who or what is making your decisions? How are you deciding upon a course of action. Certainly the objectives of the game are involved. Going for a solo or setting yourself up for a board top in a draw, and so on. Your emotions certainly have their sway too. We are quite good and backwards reasoning from emotional conclusions. We aim, then make up stories about why we are doing those things.</p>

<p>We are slaves and masters to varying layers of…<em>ourselves</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to learn about cognitive biases all humans share, you might start with Daniel Kahneman’s <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, or the paper he wrote in 1974 with friend and colleague Amos Tversky, ‘Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases’. For my money, and some variety, you might also check out Eliezer Yudkowsky’s <em>Rationality</em>, a collection of essays written across three years whilst reviewing the scientific literature of behavioral economics (it’s 2,000 pages, but quite lucid, funny, and delivered in short chunks). </p>

<p>But actively applying your newfound knowledge may prove difficult. After all, just because you know what biases you have doesn’t mean you can notice them at all times (nor do you need to). Even Mr. Kahneman acknowledges as much, and often, including recently in a live conversation with Sam Harris. <sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Our System 1 takes care of most decisions while System 2 is only brought to bear occasionally. But, if we can get beyond what Kahneman called ’What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI), or what Tetlock calls ‘tip of the nose thinking’, then we can begin to employ strategies in overcoming cognitive biases when and where they matter.</p>

<p>Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner have given us an interesting way to practice doing so in their book, <em>Super Forecasting</em>. In their story about a relatively small group of super forecasters who beat IARPA’s own government-backed researchers in a tournament of geopolitical forecasting, Tetlock and Gardner provide a blueprint for beginning one’s own journey of forecasting better than the average human (or at least better than you yourself do now).</p>

<p>Their results were impressive and their knowledge sharing is generous.</p>

<p>Useful here may be the practice they suggest of asking questions to narrow one’s attention. </p>

<p>For instance, you might ask: How likely is it that England will attempt to stab me, given this position? </p>

<p>Now, you may have an intuitive response to that. Which may include what <em>you</em> would do, what the position suggests, as well as your current relationship in this game. But that isn’t the whole story, is it?</p>

<p>What about these questions: </p>

<p>
  <em>What evidence do I have that England will stab me?</em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>In the past, when I have been stabbed by England, how was his demeanor towards me?</em>
</p>

<p>And so on. </p>

<p>If you do come to the conclusion that there is a considerable possibility of being stabbed, and there is still time to negotiate, you may do well to have a discussion about it. You may be able to sniff out the stab and persuade the Englishman to at least delay this decision. </p>

<p>This way you will not be slave to the stab nor allow the tyrant in you to stab first. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-disbelief-in-your-own-ability">Disbelief in Your Own Ability</h3>

<p>Should you really split the difference at the bargaining table? </p>

<p>I argue that often, you shouldn’t. </p>

<p>It feels like we lost when we walk away from deals, but that is only a psychological safety net built into us. You have to notice that feeling and let it go, at least sometimes.</p>

<p>Other times, you need to persist in influence opponents. What interests of theirs are you not acknowledging? Why, at the very bottom, is an opponent not seeing value in the reasons you bring? Keep searching. Stay attached yet not overly attached to a plan, especially if there is mutual value to be had. After all, you both can see the board as it is. You both see what potential there is before you. </p>

<p>Sometimes, though, in a long game of Diplomacy, we fall into a rut. We think: I can’t believe that a creature as useless as me could bring anything useful to the world.</p>

<p>Of course, this line of thinking misses something important. It fails to account for the amazing capacity you have to do better. The <em>potential</em> of your inner strength, creativity, and resourcefulness. </p>

<p>Whether at 2 centers or 12, you have the opportunity–and the responsibility–to play a great game. At least do it for the other players, if not for your own sanity.</p>

<p>Have the courage to stay in the arena. The adventure always lies ahead if you can be awake enough to notice the path.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-chain-sickness">Chain Sickness</h3>

<p>Closely related to this mental dip is the following sentiment:</p>

<p><em>Even once you’ve rid yourself of chains, you may yet retain the chain sickness.</em>  </p>

<p>Nietzsche argued that an individual who has succeeded in emancipating himself from the Church, may still, deep down, experience the chain sickness. Supposedly this led to his writing of <em>Thus Spake, Zarathustra</em>, although my scholarship on the philosopher is very limited. </p>

<p>What I have felt is a feeling of displacement and attachment to that which is no longer there. This happened when I left corporate America about five years ago, and lingered for a few years. </p>

<p>It is also felt in a haptic sense. If you wear a piece of jewelry, such as a ring, and take it off at day’s end, it often feels as though you were still wearing it. When you go to touch it, you find it isn’t there. It’s not there, so what exactly were you feeling? </p>

<p>Stubborn as I can be, I have felt this way about a failed plan in Diplomacy.</p>

<p>Abandoning plans is hard. But taking on new plans requires you to let go.</p>

<p>Playing the best game you can demands it. </p>

<p>There is hesitation, because there was something you <em>wanted</em> to be right about your previous course of action. If you take on a new course, you will be admitting you didn’t know something, or worse, that you were wrong. It’s no fun to be wrong. And to have to admit that to others is hard. </p>

<p>But if you can admit where you were wrong, you potentially gain a huge edge in Diplomacy. </p>

<p>“I miscalculated.”</p>

<p>“I made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I left myself open to that stab.”</p>

<p>These are statements that take on responsibility (instead of eschewing it). To my mind, a player who honestly makes these admissions is in a better mental state to coordinate moves over the board. He is less likely to let emotions imbalance him going forward. Leaving aside the value of stoking a player’s emotional reaction to events, hearing this kind of language is level-headed and helps me feel confident about making clear plans with this player. </p>

<p>A smaller variant of excuse-making is the type that goes like this:</p>

<p>“Russia had me cornered over there.”</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t take that stab personally.” </p>

<p>These kinds of statements lack sincerity (if indeed, you were making plans with Russia versus <em>actually</em> being cornered against your will), or, in the second case, a kind of assumed inevitability about how the victim of your stab <em>should</em> feel, when really, it is <em>their</em> decision how they deal with that outcome.</p>
