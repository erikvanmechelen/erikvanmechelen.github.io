<h2 id="Strategy">Chapter 6: Strategy</h2>

<p>When asked what is needed to prosper in Diplomacy, many players think of Strategy and Negotiation first.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, I will not bore you with what has been discovered already in the 65 years of the game, but rather with insights and speculations that hope to build on what is known, so as to stretch us into the unknown. </p>

<p>We will, as convention suggests, also touch on Opening, Mid-game, and End-game theory, though my country-specific strategy will be quite limited. I’ll aim to ask questions in lieu of offering solutions. </p>

<p>The mistake I’d like to avoid: offering a solution before a problem is properly defined.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-when-do-you-write-your-orders">When Do You Write Your Orders?</h3>

<p>Each turn, you have numerous possible orders for your collection of units. For example, Germany’s starting position alone offers over 1,000 options. True, not 1,000 viable options, but variety nonetheless!</p>

<p>How will you decide? What decision tree are you following to make the best choices? </p>

<p>We will begin this chapter with a discussion of five dimensions which should help to narrow your good options. </p>

<p>As was recently shared with me by the MN Diplomacy Club president, Ben Johnson, European players tend to write their orders first, then spend the negotiations period persuading others of their plans. Americans, meanwhile, have ideas about what they want to do, but generally do not put their orders on paper until having discussions.</p>

<p>Merits to writing orders first: one can focus on actively listening, identifying areas to offer assistance, bargaining for influence, prying for more information, and otherwise enjoying the pursuit of affecting the board in conjunction with your own best set of orders. </p>

<p>You also avoid the dreaded No Move Received (NMR) where all your units Hold.</p>

<p>Merits to writing orders after having diplomacy with other players: one can attend to problems and plans posed by other players without being overly constrained by your own predefined move-set. </p>

<p>A happy medium: Writing a few good order sets and crossing out those that turn out not to be viable later. Depending on how you think, this may be too much information to handle…what if you cross out the wrong orders? There is the added downside of revealing to the reader of the orders the crossed out orders, though this is a minor psychological concession (most of the time).</p>

<p>Either way, developing an understanding and framework for concepts like Pace (or Tempo), Shape (or Cohesiveness), Influence (or Pressure), Growth, and Targets will ease your decision-making concerns.</p>

<p>I highly recommend investing in this theory, especially if you are an analytical type who likes to weigh all his tactical options. The framework will more quickly get you into the negotiations arena, where you need to be to win the game. </p>

<p>(Additionally, you will know when an opponent is trying to sell you a bad plan.)</p>

<p>
  <strong>Concepts</strong>
</p>

<p>Pace (or Tempo), Shape (or Cohesiveness), Influence (or Pressure), Growth, and Targets make up a five-dimensional framework which assist your negotiations.</p>

<p>In this framing, you might consider re-reading the the chapter on <a href="chap07.html#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> after you read this one. The reason <a href="chap07.html#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> comes slightly ahead of Strategy in priority is simply that, no matter how much you understand about the strategy of Diplomacy, if you can’t negotiate well, you stand little chance of succeeding.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-pace">Pace</h3>

<p>My Russian soccer coach once took our team to watch a game in Asia’s Tiger Cup. The game was held at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium. I don’t recall whether the game was between Indonesia and Thailand or Malaysia and Thailand, or none of these, but it doesn’t matter. My coach asked me to watch for one of the team’s strategy and report back at halftime. </p>

<p>That was fine by me. I settled into the hard plastic seat: soccer halves are 45 minutes long. Might as well get as comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>But when a group of men sat down around us–remember, I was only fourteen or fifteen years old–and starting and never stopped smoking, it was hard to pay attention to the match. (This is where I laugh, recalling what a college friend told me years later as I avoided second-hand smoke: “You see Erik, that’s the difference between you and me–you’re trying to hold your breath and turn away, but me, well I’m trying to get a hit.”)</p>

<p>At halftime my coach turns around and asks: “So what’s their strategy?”</p>

<p>I drew a blank and my coach was disappointed. He made it sound so simple: “They’re playing an up-tempo <em>defense</em>. Whenever they lose the ball, they press their midfield and backs very high up the pitch. Of course this leaves them vulnerable at the back, if they are picked apart. But on the other hand, if they win the ball <em>back</em>, they will have scoring chances.” </p>

<p>We went on to discuss the merits and demerits of such a strategy. To play a high tempo defensive strategy, you need fit players that work hard for 90 minutes. You need a speedy back-line, because the opposing side may counter with long balls. If the opposing team is an excellent passing team, a high tempo defensive strategy will be less effective: the ball will ping about faster than even a cohesive group of defensive players can intercept or disrupt. </p>

<p>How does this relate to Diplomacy?</p>

<p>Each turn, your units have many options. Since your units occupying additional supply centers is the only way to advance in the game, you might reason that moving as efficiently as possible toward those supply centers (be they neutral or another player’s) is a good approach. </p>

<p>You wouldn’t be wrong. </p>

<p>But your reasoning would also not be <em>complete</em>. </p>

<p>Simply moving at high speeds won’t be effective in all situations. (Sing high when they sing low; sing fast when they sing slow.) If, as France, you are planning a side-door convoy into Liverpool in 1902 or 1903, you might do well to disguise your intentions so as to avoid a defensive build from England. </p>

<p>Consider that certain arrangements and territories on the board allow for great potential speed or flexibility, sometimes both. F MAO and F SPA(sc) can be sent north to prepare a convoy into Lvp or Wal as well as shifted east into Naf and WES to put two units adjacent to Tunis. </p>

<p>This very example actually represents a version of up-tempo defense, in the sense that F MAO and F Spa(sc) also may be used to guard ENG, Bre, Mar, and GoL. </p>

<p>Sometimes you <em>will</em> have to tradeoff all-out speed for effective speed. Common examples of this are any moves that avoid unneeded or undesired bounces. <em>Particularly</em> if you are planning a chain-move, a 50% chance or higher of the lead unit bouncing is quite annoying and a questionable gamble (if negotiations have not produced better odds). </p>

<p>In the image below, Russia and Austria have DMZ’d Galicia, but then Serbia has accepted Turkey’s support of A Ser-Rum. This move is disastrous for Russia, since the Czar also attempted to “guarantee” Rumania by giving up the Black Sea. Ouch.</p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">

    <img src="images/failedrussianchain.png" alt="A failed Russian chain move." style="width: 100%;" />
    <figcaption>A failed Russian chain move.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>But do not be afraid of bounces, either.</p>

<p>For instance, assuring Rumania in Spring 1901 as Russia (F Sev-Rum) immediately gives up the Black Sea to Turkey, which could be quite uncomfortable as the game progresses.</p>

<p>Germany and France may arrange bounces in Burgundy for mutual defense, whilst bounces in Galicia are not uncommon. Somewhat less common are bounces in Spring 1901 by England and France, because those units do really have better things to be doing (if either player could be assured that the bounce was 100% going to take place).</p>

<p>Your builds will also very much effect your tempo. An army build in Berlin versus Munich (if even to disguise potential moves against France), has the demerits of Russia’s questions and slower tempo against France–for your sake, I hope the Frenchman does not strike first! </p>

<p>Builds should be considered greatly in your tempo considerations. If the board seems ready for a pivot, a misplacement could see you miss out on potential gains. </p>

<p>One final note on pace (for now): </p>

<p>Mind that you don’t grow too quickly and too fast, lest other players take notice (how will they not?). The first mover doesn’t always have the advantage.<sup id="fnref-foo1"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo1" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> </p>

<p>Consider this, too: Avoid the first wrong move. Instead, look for the first right move. Act decisively once you spot it. Hat tip to Andrew Goff here whilst giving a post-game analysis of WDC 2016.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-shape-or-cohesiveness">Shape (or Cohesiveness)</h3>

<p>The modern-day National Basketball League (NBA) is all but dominated but pace and space offenses. If you can drive the pace and keep the floor spaced, you get easy buckets inside or wide-open three pointers. The Golden State Warriors took what the Pheonix Suns started in the Mike D’Antoni and Steve Nash era and, with the Splash Brothers in Klay Thompson and Steph Curry, changed the NBA. </p>

<p>The Rockets General Manager Darrel Morey has spoken about building his team (also coached by D’Antoni) to beat the Warriors at their own game. As of 2019, they have put shooters around the dynamic James Harden and sidekick Chris Paul in an attempt to outscore you. You may make a lot of 2-point shots, but when they are raining 3-pointers, the numbers don’t add up in your favor.</p>

<p>In Diplomacy, all armies and fleets are equal in the sense that they have an attribute strength of 1. However, armies and fleets <em>behave</em> differently. Situationally, armies <em>feel</em> like the power forwards and centers of the NBA, a strong inside presence. Meanwhile, the fleets can <em>feel</em> like three-point shooters on the wings, keeping a spacing that is difficult to defend. </p>

<p>Overall, I like to think of my mix of armies and fleets as a single dynamic unit or <em>character</em> with various attributes like strength, shape, or cohesiveness. As in Chess, it is usually better for your units to be able to support and work together, whether these be pawn chains or bigger pieces working together. </p>

<p>In coastal regions, armies and fleets work particularly well together (especially if your target has no fleets to cut <em>your</em> fleet’s support). Of course, in landlocked areas, a corps of armies can do well on attack and defense. </p>

<p>As is common in Chess commentary, where it might be noted that the knight on A3 feels misplaced, there is such a thing as a misplaced unit in Diplomacy as well.</p>

<p>What is an example of a misplaced unit? </p>

<p>In a recent face-to-face game I GM’d, Germany owned the North Sea and decided to convoy an army into England. This left him open to an (unexpected) Austrian attack on Munich from Bohemia. The Austria player shrugged. Munich was, after all, undefended. Seeing the German army convoy to Edinburgh only incentivized the attack. You might also say that Germany’s fleet in Kiel was misplaced in the sense that it offered no defensive assistance to Munich.</p>

<p>Units can be tactically misplaced, diplomatically misplaced, strategically misplaced, and so on. It is common for players to negotiate repositioning before being able to work together productively.</p>

<p>Every unit on the board will affect incentives and influence.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, paying attention to your cohesion and the mix of armies and fleets is critical. In the early game, build appropriately to maintain your cohesion, and do your best to anticipate your opponents’ builds as well. </p>

<p>If your pieces are working well together, you don’t <em>need</em> that many units to have great defensive and offensive prospects. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-influence-or-pressure">Influence (or Pressure)</h3>

<p>I am of the same mind of World Champions like Chris Martin who advocate England opening to the English Channel more often. England may worry he can’t guarantee a build if he both gets bounced by France <em>and</em> Russia opens A Mos-StP, but in a vacuum this combination of outcomes is both unlikely and foretells trouble in any event when it <em>does</em> occur.</p>

<p>Please, just open to the English Channel. At least a little more often. It’s not as anti-French as you may think.</p>

<p>Are you still unsure about the English Channel? Consider this: the Sultan and Czar have no problem bouncing in the Black Sea, so why should the President and Prime Minister be so opposed to bouncing in the Channel? (<em>Of course</em>, if you and France can avoid the Channel early for strategic cooperation, this is also reasonable for both parties. As France, you can tackle England later, and as England, likewise.)</p>

<p>Certain territories–but really <em>any</em> territories your units occupy–exert a direct influence on neighboring territories. Supports can be given or cut. Moves into those territories can be made. And all of this <em>potentially</em> could happen. Bargaining chips and tokens. </p>

<p>If early game pace might be used for anything, keep an eye for the opportunity to occupy <em>influential</em> territories in a cohesive manner. Your early game center count is somewhat less important than your <em>potential</em> for growth and tempo. (For some powers more than others–Italy, for example, need not get to five centers immediately, although once Italy does, it becomes formidable.)  </p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 288px;">

    <figcaption>For example, this is decent for England.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Having your pieces in important positions, ultimately, provides leverage. The Frenchman wants your fleet out of the Channel. Your reply may be: “Sure, how about we land it in Belgium?” Then again, once you gain a deeper understanding of the game, you may value your fleet occupying the English Channel more than a dot that is Belgium (especially if that center becomes difficult to hold).</p>

<p>Other early game territories include Burgundy, Galicia, and even Armenia. Consider the Turkish opening: </p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 287px;">
    <img src="images/Topen_arm.png" alt="Opening to Armenia at least gives the Turk some leverage." style="width: 100%;" />
    <figcaption>Opening to Armenia at least gives the Turk some leverage.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>As Turkey you may worry about antagonizing Russia or about holding Bulgaria. Antagonizing Russia could be a problem. As for Bulgaria, you will hold it unless Russia and Austria are firmly against you and Italy has not ventured into Trieste or Tyrolia. There is the added benefit of being able to build F <em>Con</em> in Winter 1901. </p>

<p>For my money, Armenia looks pretty decent. I hear The Weasels in Chicago tend to agree.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-growth">Growth</h3>

<p>After the neutral dots have been collected or divided, how will you grow? Inevitably, you will have to take supply center from a neighbor. </p>

<p>But first, let’s discuss a theory of growth. </p>

<p>It is well documented that, for example, Germany and Austria do quite well when ending 1901 on 5 centers, but less well when ending on 6 dots. </p>

<p>How could this be? </p>

<p>The simplest idea seems best here. If a player has 6, it’s more likely neighbors have 5 or 4 (or 3), and this imbalance–or <em>unfairness</em>–tends to create good arguments to form coalitions against the 6-center power. In short, it gives players easy answers. If there isn’t already a villain, players have to work harder to create them.</p>

<p>Bear this in mind. Although if you <em>are</em> the Bear (Russia), getting 6 is completely fine–especially if Sweden was an offer from Germany for a few years of good relations whilst you sort out the south. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-targets">Targets</h3>

<p>Choosing a target in the early-, mid-, or late-opening is imperative to make progress. </p>

<p>Once you have a plan, persuade others to join you in it, and then carry out said plan. </p>

<p>But wait, how can I suggest all of this so plainly? </p>

<p>As has already been discussed at length in <a href="chap07.html#Negotiation">Negotiation</a>, your ability to persuade others of your joint interests and plans to achieve them will be very important in taking dots off your targets. </p>

<p>There is a saying in poker: “If you don’t know who the fish is at the table, it’s you.” </p>

<p>In Diplomacy, if you don’t know who the target is, it’s you.</p>

<p>But what should each power’s early targets be? </p>

<p>Simply put, I believe targets should depend on several factors, including your read of who is a target of other players on the board. </p>

<p>If you do have an early-game target in mind, your aim may be to secure the neutrals whilst also establishing an influential or even objectively strong position relative to the potential target. This position, while dangerous looking to the target, should, with your diplomatic prowess, be manageable, while also giving credence to your requests for assistance against the target. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-secrets">Secrets</h3>

<p>There will be moments in the course of a Diplomacy game in which you uncover secrets. These may be secrets of your opponent’s grand strategy, a secret about your collaborator’s psychology, or perhaps a secret about your own devious subconscious. </p>

<p>Now that you have uncovered this knowledge, will you make use of it? This is the first question, and not as easy as it sounds. As in the movie <em>Rounders</em> (where the protagonist spots a physical tell in his poker opponent), you may not want to reveal your knowledge of a valuable secret, if there are ways for you to exploit it quietly, in nominal ways, for a long time.</p>

<p>As is a general theme, do not make the first wrong move with your secret. Rather, make the first <em>good</em> move with your newfound knowledge. Marketing and sales is as important as the idea or product.</p>

<p>Maybe, after consideration, you decide to watch for moments to deploy this knowledge (to your advantage, of course). </p>

<p>If you do make use of it, how will you do this, and when, and under what circumstances? </p>

<p>Having a plan to deploy information such as this–your secrets–is critical. It allows you to be triggered by your pre-made plans and not have to constantly spend mental resources deciding whether to carry out a potential tactic or not.</p>

<p>I recommend using your secrets as discreetly as you can, but as powerfully as you can. </p>

<p>As with your general <a href="chap07.html#Negotiation">Negotiation</a> strategy, putting other players on the defensive often will not free their own mental resources to create value on your behalf. However, if you have both leverage <em>and</em> a secret, the revealing of which may hurt your negotiations partner, positioning your “news” as a threat could be called for.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-theory-opening-mid-game-end-game">Theory: Opening, Mid-Game, End-Game</h3>

<p>By now you’ve realized I seem to approach things in reverse. Where one person starts with opening theory on page 1 of a Diplomacy Guide, in this manual opening theory gets short shrift until now. </p>

<p>But that <em>is</em> interesting, isn’t it? </p>

<p>By now you probably don’t even need to read this section. You’re quite possibly equipped to stand over the board and develop your own theory, country by country, season by season. I highly encourage you do. </p>

<p>After a few weeks, you can return here and see if I cause you to think anything new. Likely not, if you’ve thought clearly and carefully enough, without presupposition, and with enough imagination. </p>

<p>At any rate, to get to opening theory, you will have to fight through end-game and mid-game theory first!</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-end-game">End-Game</h5>

<p>Just as chess grand masters and nine don Go players have excellent technique in the end-game of their chosen fields, top Diplomacy players understand how to settle scores and mend broken alliances (if needed) to secure the stalemate positions that prevent further progress. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dipwiki.com/index.php?title=The_Gamer%27s_Guide_To_Diplomacy:_Stalemates">Key stalemate lines</a> are explained in several areas in the literature, including the DipWiki.</p>

<p>Depending on the format of your neighborhood, club, or tournament game, an understanding of these non-solo end-game positions provides additional strategic, diplomatic, and tactical considerations. Be sure to assess your opponents’ understanding of these positions. Late-game stabs that get you to, say, 13 or 14 centers, may strategically be <em>unsound</em>, but may actually get you to 18 if playing against incompetent opponents. Obviously, soloing isn’t as satisfying against newer players as against very good players, but it is a solo nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>Where</em> you’d like to position your pieces creates the need for plans to achieve those positions. For example, a Turkish army in Ukraine is extraordinarily powerful. But how will you actually get it there, and can you manage it while also maintaining good piece coordination and shape? </p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 288px;">

    <figcaption>A Turkish Army’s Path May Vary</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>Option 1 above sees you breaking into Sev from Armenia. </p>

<p>Option 2 has you with F BLA providing a convoy to Rum or Sev. </p>

<p>Option 3 shows the long march through the Balkans.</p>

<p>Each path is viable, depending on your strategy, cooperation with Austria or Italy, and the potential timing of the attack against Russia.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-mid-game">Mid-Game</h5>

<p>For my money the mid-game is entered after one or more powers take considerable hits. The game flow may change as players assess the board position and potentially choose new targets. </p>

<p>Sometimes it is where players assume secondary goals. Watch these strategic and psychological transitions carefully. Yet another reason–but did you really need another?–to maintain a good speaking relationship with as many if not all players throughout the balance of the game. </p>

<p>Good diplomacy and solid tactics alone can get you into a decent early game position, but the mid-game is most fruitful for very good players who understand the where and how positions may shift. They are good and creating new avenues for growth, and for playing balance of power if their section of the board hasn’t progressed or consolidated at the same pace as other parts of the board. </p>

<p>If your pieces are cohesive and occupying influential positions, the mid-game becomes enticing indeed as multiple players may come to you requesting the service of your position. You may well be able to create value for them and for yourself. </p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-the-opening">The Opening</h5>

<p>I remember my first game of Diplomacy. (I remember almost all of my face to face games…I’m not sure why this is.) </p>

<p>I bet you remember yours, too. The European landscape, carved as it is into the shape befitting Allan B. Calhamer’s vision, is intriguing. Where should your armies march and your fleets sail? </p>

<p>Others have commented at length on the opening, including in 1970 Richard Sharp’s <em>The Game of Diplomacy</em><sup id="fnref-foo3"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo3" rel="footnote">20</a></sup> and more recently Andrew Goff’s blog on openings.<sup id="fnref-foo4"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo4" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> Note that Richard Sharp preferred an active game where all seven players played both strategically and tactically sound games. He seems to have preferred agreements to alliances, and so forth. Differing on some dimensions is a player like Andrew Goff, who in a preliminary round of the 2018 WDC as England opened A Lvp <em>holds</em> (naturally, to show the Russia with intent that the army will not be arriving in Norway in Fall 1901). </p>

<p>While it is very effective to understand how a power can achieve 18 centers, and work backwards from that destination to the opening, there are some differences to games (like chess) where this approach has more value. </p>

<p>In chess, the position tends to simplify over time as pieces are removed from the board. In Diplomacy, there will almost always be 34 units on the board. The changes are in the owner of those units, the mix of fleets and armies, their positioning, and whether they are available to coordinate with your own (if they are not owned by you). </p>

<p>Because an opposing player’s units always have the <em>potential</em> to support or attack your own units, the Opening in Diplomacy is slightly more critical than the opening in Chess or the first bet in a poker hand. Because the positioning of your units will continue to influence the position not only in the next season but probably years hence, those first decisions mean a lot. Pawn to E4 (Fischer’s “Best by Test”) can transpose into many openings, whereas F Ank-Con (while flexible), often gives up the Black Sea or suggests early-game cooperation with Russia. </p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-country-specific-strategy">Country-Specific Strategy</h5>

<p>I am largely going to avoid the area of specific advice country by country. Richard Gee has well pointed out that even among top players, there is considerable bias at play in country by country analysis.</p>

<p>Gee writes of Richard Sharp’s England advice, for example: </p>

<p>“The chapter on England for example, states “ENG at all cost!” and a close reading reveals that England and France must always be at war. In truth any serious opening against Ger. is omitted.  It would also appear that no mention is made of how England can arrange matters so that France / Germany end up in a fight over Belgium.  Furthermore there is no discussion on the concept of The Western Alliance. The only conclusion is that the author has seen to it that England has pulled her punches as far as Germany is concerned.”<sup id="fnref-foo5"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo5" rel="footnote">22</a></sup></p>

<p>I do not wish to impart similar misknowledge, nor, as will be discussed in <a href="chap09.html#Exploration">Exploration</a>, do I wish to <em>steal your destiny</em> from you. Unlocking strategic insights in Diplomacy is largely an individual adventure, it seems. Top players like Andrew Goff seem to agree.<sup id="fnref-foo6"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo6" rel="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<p>So far in this book I have suggested on multiple occasions that England not relinquish the Channel early to France, but players like Steve Jones, commenting in an article published in ‘Richard’s Bull Run’ in May 1984, suggests that either Germany or Russia should be removed as a threat before focusing on France. It seems this discussion has been going on for a long time. And will continue to do so to all our delight. </p>

<p>Speaking of delight, let us now discuss the art of the stab.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-toward-a-philosophy-of-stabs">Toward a Philosophy of Stabs</h3>

<p>Much has been written about stabs. And rightfully so. </p>

<p>Stabs, as I first understood them, referred to cooperative or even tightly-allied players making an unexpected move against the other, usually at an opportune time, leading to supply centers exchanging hands. (In Richard Sharp’s line of thinking, if read a certain way, there is no such thing as a stab, since there are no alliances, only players making agreements to better their positions.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, these moves were coordinated with another player, suggesting a shift in allegiances, possibly warranted by the overall state of the board and usually aligned with the newly cooperating players’ long term objectives (usually, winning the game). </p>

<p>In this context, stabs are all but inevitable. For most great powers, it is difficult to solo (18 centers) without working against an early-game collaborator. The inequality of the starting positions establishes this reality. </p>

<p>Given that stabs are inevitable, continuing this line of reasoning, stabs need not be viewed negatively. Sure, they seem to have a negative outcome for the player stabbed, but that player should not <em>really</em> have been expecting the game to go on without one forever. </p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-valuing-stabs">Valuing Stabs</h4>

<p>From a numbers perspective, stabs that take 2 or 3 centers from another player are better than a stab which takes 0 or 1. If you go +2 and your opponent goes -2, that’s a 4-center swing. You’ve got 6-center swing if you go +3 and your opponent goes -3. </p>

<p>Depending on the center counts, unit placement, and prospects, </p>

<p>The player you stab will likely have to remove unit(s) from the board. Factor this into your pre-stab calculations as well. What kind of player are you dealing with? Will he remove units on your front, or from another player’s? Will <em>you</em> actually be the player to gain most from a stab in the medium term? (If you aren’t, the stab is highly questionable.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common mistake (beyond a failed stab), is not understanding how your stab will play out in the medium term (and long term). If in two to three years, a neighbor gains more than you, and you’ve created one or more enemies via the stab itself, has the stab truly succeeded? </p>

<p>Remember, the stab must help you <em>win</em> the game. If the stab merely gets you to 14 centers without real prospects for 18, then the stab might be premature. </p>

<p>(In tournament games or top boards with uncertain clock end times, there are caveats to the above.)</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-when-to-avoid-obvious-stabs">When to Avoid Obvious Stabs</h4>

<p>When you can’t get to 18, it’s probably not time to stab.  </p>

<p>It will be tempting though. </p>

<p>Perhaps you can practice avoiding temptation by realizing that, like the child who is offered a cookie now, or three cookies in ten minutes, that there is more to be gained with patience and sacrifice.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-invite-a-stab">How to Invite a Stab</h4>

<p>Because of the tactical, strategical, and psychological effect stabs have on the flavor and texture of the game, inviting a stab <em>against</em> you can be tremendously beneficial. </p>

<p>The key is, of course, is to understand how you will survive such a stab. </p>

<p>Then, if this is arranged, how the stab will be encouraged. </p>

<p>Finally, once the stab is made against you, the final piece is to market and sell that you indeed <em>have</em> been stabbed. </p>

<p>Once stabbed, you can likely gain the cooperation of neighboring players to save your game or to work together against the stabber. </p>

<p>Recently, Andrew Goff used such an early-game strategy as England to invite a stab and then subsequently work with France to dismantle the German (the stabber). </p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-risk-of-ruin">Risk of Ruin</h4>

<p>In discussions with my brother Mark relating to the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, namely Prospect Theory, a common topic is <strong>Risk of Ruin</strong>. Prospect Theory says we put a premium on the chance to avoid losses (versus a smaller sure loss) as well as pay too much to assure a gain (even when the expected value of a probabilistic wager is stronger). Kahneman and Tversky conclude that humans are irrational. You just have to trust me that I am not straw-manning their position here.</p>

<p>My brother Mark has little tolerance for the viewpoint that human beings are irrational, at least given merely this evidence. </p>

<p>For a living Mark created models to help traders better understand their overall risk. In his risk management models you could see which traders were betting more of ‘the farm’ than was prudent. This led to course corrections or discussions between those traders and their peers or management. </p>

<p>Let me present you a deal right now. </p>

<p>2/3 of the time, you win $1,000,000. </p>

<p>1/3 of the time, you lose $1,000,000. </p>

<p>Do you take it?</p>

<p>In a vacuum, you should take this bet <em>all day long</em>, and as many times as you are offered it. </p>

<p>The problem is, you aren’t in a vacuum. You’re in your life, with all the circumstances, obligations, and responsibilities it entails. </p>

<p>If you are only offered the bet <em>once</em>, there is a tremendous amount to consider here. </p>

<p>Even if your net worth was, say, $3,000,000, you’d be putting 1/3 of that net worth at risk right there. You wouldn’t be ruined if you lost, but ending up at $2,000,000 might hurt <em>more</em> than $4,000,000 felt good. </p>

<p>If you’re like me and your net worth is less than $1,000,000, then losing this bet puts you at a negative net worth. </p>

<p>In effect, your <em>risk of ruin</em> on this bet is 1/3. One out of three times, which is quite a lot!, you will have ruined yourself, your family, and everyone who depends on you. </p>

<p>I personally think that the idea of risk of ruin percolates into smaller and perhaps less life-altering wagers, and rightfully so. </p>

<p>For example, this concept of risk of ruin played out throughout my poker career, when I risked too much ‘taking shots’ at higher stakes than my bank account could tolerate. When I couldn’t buy back in at the higher stakes, I was ‘ruined’ at those stakes, and had to drop down to much lower stakes to rebuild my bankroll. </p>

<p>In Diplomacy, there are situations where your risk of ruin should affect your decision making. Having a sense for how it may affect your opponents’ decision making (if they are your targets), will also help greatly. </p>

<p>Against certain Italian players, for example, it may be too much of a risk to leave Trieste unguarded in Spring 1901. To have a chance at Greece, bargain for a DMZ in Galicia, send your fleet Trieste to Albania, and send Vienna to cover the vacated home center.</p>

<p>You can probably think of several more situations like this. </p>

<p>Examples include mid-game alliance stabs and overly zealous builds, like Russian fleet StP (nc) in Winter 1901, while there is still much to work out in the Balkans.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-how-to-defend">How to Defend</h3>

<p>Sometimes you are a target. Don’t sweat it. Remain calm. Breathe. Urge blood back into your system. Have a stretch. You might even smile next, envisioning the moment a few game years from now when your opponents shrug, give up, and choose easier fish to cook. And then you’ll be back in the game!</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-disincentivize-crippling-moves">Disincentivize Crippling Moves</h4>

<p>Do not make it too easy to attack you. </p>

<p>Do not make it too easy to stab you, if in a collaboration, cooperation, or alliance.</p>

<p>If an opponent is within two moves (perhaps a Spring followed by a Fall move) of an unguarded supply center, which you cannot defend in two turns, you may be inviting the move (if not now, later). Same goes for multiple centers within one or more moves.</p>

<p>Caveat may be: You <em>are</em> strategically inviting a stab which you know will not hurt you too badly in order to gain diplomatically with other players in the medium term.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-position-units-to-defend">Position Units to Defend</h4>

<p>When an attack seems imminent, either by your opponents’ unit density near your territory or by the expressions on your conversation counterparts, or by the long waits to speak with neighbors during negotiation periods, you can do worse than positioning your units to defend the expected attack. </p>

<p>Occupying certain territories with the correct unit cohesion will make it difficult to break you. Because a neighbor’s attacks against you require resources and time, if you can sustain an attack, other players on the board may react opportunistically to imbalances created by the attack on you. You must persevere!</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-gathering-help">Gathering Help</h4>

<p>Advertise to other players who stand to help you how well you are defending. </p>

<p>“Look, this attack isn’t going to work. They will be giving up soon after they realize they can’t force the North Sea.” </p>

<p>“It’s going to take them two game years to have chances to break through the Aegean. By that time, you’ll be ready to nab some of his dots yourself.”</p>

<p>And so on. </p>

<p>Apply your emotional persuasion as appropriate to each player in the game, just as you would any negotiation. </p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-persuasion-and-probability-gathering">Persuasion and Probability Gathering</h4>

<p>When your defensive stands come down to the nitty-gritty, you sometimes have to make probabilistic decisions. <em>Any</em> information you gather whether from the attackers themselves or from other players (who may have heard about the attacks) will help you “guess” correctly. </p>

<p>For instance, I recently watched the following situation play out between England and France in a face to face club game of the Minnesota Diplomacy Club: </p>


<div class="figure-wrapper center">
  <figure class="image" style="width: 149px;">
    <img src="images/guessinggame.png" alt="A Guessing Game." style="width: 100%;" />
    <figcaption>A Guessing Game.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


<p>I was playing a good Turkey in this game, but had no interest in seeing England fail so quickly to France. (I wanted Russia to be busy later and, as this was a short game, didn’t want France to grow too quickly.)</p>

<p>I pointed out to the down-on-his-luck Englishman that he actually had a guessing game on his hands. He could support himself into Wales to create a brace, as shown in the figure above. Or, if he expected France to anticipate this, could order A Lvp-Wal (or A Lvp H) and F Lon-Wal. </p>

<p>
  <em>If France anticipated A Lvp-Wal with F Lon S Lvp-Wal (the only move that blocks French A Wal-Lvp with F Iri S Wal-Lvp), then France could simply play F Iri-Lvp and A Wal-Yor!</em>
</p>

<p>I encouraged the Englishman to appeal to other players for <em>any</em> information they may have on the Frenchman’s plans. I don’t know if this worked, but the brace occurred and there was a standoff that Fall season. Good news for the English and the Turks. (France still went on to board top, but with a tougher road.)</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-what-do-gascony-and-livonia-have-in-common">What do Gascony and Livonia have in Common?</h3>

<p>Besides being featured in two of my favorite <em>interesting</em> openings, Gascony and Livonia are important spaces in the sense of providing defensive, offensive, and repositioning potential. These spaces are influential diplomatically, as well, when your units occupy them. </p>

<p>The Iberian Indecision (A Mar-Spa; A Par-Gas; F Bre-MAO) gives flexibility against both England and Germany and lets England and Germany scrap over Belgium. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Livonian Lunacy has its merits against an overtly troublesome German.<sup id="fnref-foo7"><a href="chap14.html#fn-foo7" rel="footnote">24</a></sup> </p>

<p>Both Gascony and Livonia, though, are important mid-game territories. Consider Gascony, which can defend Paris and Marseilles, or be convoyed to Wales. Livonia can defend Saint Petersburg and Warsaw while also convoying to Kiel. Interestingly, on the other side of it, Gascony and Livonia are not unusual landing zones for English or German armies.</p>

<p>Apulia, Albania, Wales, and Yorkshire have a similar feel, with varying situational utility.</p>

<p>Now, instead of belaboring points that have already been made, I would like to take this opportunity to share one or two openings I like, <strong>The Skagerrak Sentry</strong> (for Germany) and then <strong>The Venetian Vanishing</strong> for an Austrian/Italian cooperation.</p>

<p>These are simply a few fun openings you might consider situationally. </p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-the-skagerrak-sentry">The Skagerrak Sentry</h3>

<aside>
  <h3 id="leanpub-auto-the-situation">The Situation</h3>
  <p>You were lucky and drew <em>Germany</em> in the final game of a 3-game tournament.
How will you open? </p>

  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-consider">Consider</h4>
  <p>England is a strong player. Russia, too. You’d prefer not to ally with either, however, as you need a 9 or 10 center result to have a chance at winning the tournament.
You happen to know France needs a big result, too. </p>

</aside>

<p>France’s desire to quickly gain centers makes him a natural early game ally in the carving up of England. But you need to ensure you get a bigger piece of England than France does. After England’s dismantling, you will have the opportunity to maintain your alliance with France to move on Russia OR to break through into the English Channel or Burgundy in an attack on France. </p>

<p>(You’ve opted out of the Sealion, since you don’t want to be too friendly with Russia and you’d prefer the edge over France in England’s spoils.)</p>

<p>Early diplomacy suggests Russia will have his hands full with a possible Austrian-Turkish alliance. </p>

<p>Maybe you can offer Russia Sweden in 1901 in exchange for building in the south (where he will need defenses against AT anyway). </p>

<p>Now, you’re left with a decision on your opening. </p>

<p>A creative approach in keeping with your diplomatic agreements and suggestions, might be the <strong>Skagerrak Sentry</strong>. (This opening is a situational variant of <strong>The Jutland Gambit</strong>.)</p>

<p>In Spring 1901, begin with the Blitzkrieg Opening, Danish Variant. </p>

  <h4 id="leanpub-auto-the-jutland-gambit">The Jutland Gambit</h4>

  <p>F Den-SKA<br />
A Kie-Den<br />
A Ruh-Hol</p>

</aside>

<p>In this situation, I am proposing to refer to the Jutland Gambit as the <strong>Skagerrak Sentry</strong>. </p>

<p>In my understanding, the point of the Jutland Gambit is to delay the choice of a victim. However, in the current scenario, you as Germany have a pre-arranged alliance with France and planned attack on England. The point of the move F Den-SKA provides diplomatic and tactical influence to dissuade England of your intentions. </p>

<p>In this game, England self-bounces in London to keep it open for a build.</p>

<p>England will have to continue to play very well to remain in the game.</p>

<p>Even if England has begun to sniff out your intended antagonism, you as Germany are still in a very good position to work with France to pick apart England. </p>

<p>You will likely be building 2 as Germany: a fleet in Kiel and an army of your choosing. (Occasionally, with your second build you can construct a third fleet in Berlin.)</p>

<p>In this scenario, your ally France has picked up 2 builds.</p>

<p>From here, with or without French support from ENG, you can aim for a fleet in NTH by Spring or Fall 1902. </p>

<p>(Even if the English manage to hold NTH, your F SKA is an excellent positional diplomatic tool with both England and Russia.)</p>

<p>Once your German fleets command the North Sea, the wind is most certainly at your back!</p>

<p>Congratulations, you’ve succeeded in implementing the <strong>Skagerrak Sentry</strong>.</p>

<p>Just don’t be too proud of yourself until you wrap up the board top. </p>

<aside class="tip blurb">
    <p>Remember to advertise your move to SKA as beneficial to both England and Russia. England probably has a right to skepticism (you’ve allowed Russia into Sweden), but you can point out that you do now have two units bordering Sweden (to be used at the right time). Keep Turkey and Austria active as you will need Russia to be occupied long enough for you to carve England and prepare for your middle game. </p>

<p>With only one unit bordering Greece (A Ser), there are possibilities diplomatically that are far-reaching.</p>

<p>One approach: As Italy, encourage Turkey to bounce Austria’s A Ser-Gre, in order to occupy the Bulgarian army. </p>

<p>Austria can then play Russia and Turkey off one another, depending on if Russia is in Gal or Rum, and what happened in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Proceed, in Fall, with the following:</p>

<p>Austria disbands the fleet and hopefully builds 2 armies.</p>

<p>While Italy doesn’t build, the position is stable to deflect the Turkish F Smy-AEG in Spring, before relinquishing it in Fall 1902 in order to take Tunis by convoy. Depending on the appetite of Austria/Italy, Italy can take Trieste for himself as part of the agreement in 1902. </p>

<p>By then, Austria’s <em>five</em> armies will have had a chance to wreak havoc in the Balkans.</p>
